        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-37 is a cyan colored liquid of unknown composition. Abnormality-37 is acidic and corrosive. However, Abnormality-37’s corrosive effects only applies to inanimate objects. Any inanimate objects, regardless of what it is, will be melted by Abnormality-37. However, any living things that come in contact with Abnormality-37 will not be affected by Abnormality-37’s corrosive effects. The only way a person could die due to Abnormality-37 is by drowning inside Abnormality-37. Due to Abnormality-37’s nature of corroding any object it comes into contact with, Abnormality-37 is very difficult to transport to a different location. So far, the only object that could hold Abnormality-37 is a 5 meter square bathtub designated as Abnormality-37A. Abnormality-37A is capable of holding Abnormality-37 despite being an inanimate object, suffering no corrosion even after prolonged exposure. Research indicates Abnormality-37A to be a regular big bathtub. There are approximately 4 meter square of Abnormality-37 contained within Abnormality-37A. Abnormality-37 has a density of 0.5 kilogram per meter square. Abnormality-37 is determined to be acidic, but it is impossible to determine the entity’s exact ph.

        Addenda

      <h3>
        Addendum 37-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that drinking Abnormality-37 has no harmful effects. The human body is unable to process Abnormality-37. As such, Abnormality-37 will be excreted as it is with feces and urine. Additionally, it was noticed that a person’s body hair and nails will not disintegrate when swimming in Abnormality-37, yet cut nails and hair will disintegrate in Abnormality-37. Animals are also shown to be immune to Abnormality-37’s effects, with the only possibility of dying caused by drowning. Biological compounds separated from a living thing such as feces, bones, and enzymes are also prone to disintegration to Abnormality-37.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 37-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Anything that is not Abnormality-37 itself will be disintegrated by Abnormality-37. Gas and liquid objects are not immune to disintegration by Abnormality-37. If fire was put into Abnormality-37, the fire will immediately be extinguished and the burning material immediately disintegrated. Body organs and blood will not immediately disintegrate upon contact with Abnormality-37, but will disintegrate after prolonged contact. Additionally, it has been noticed that Abnormality-37A is fairly weak and fragile despite being able to withstand Abnormality-37’s corrosive effects. There is no known method to repair Abnormality-37A, so caution must be enforced to prevent the only possible container for Abnormality-37 from breaking. Abnormality-37’s danger level has been changed from 0 to 1.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-37 was found in the Underground Research Institution in Africa. Abnormality-37 and Abnormality-37A was left untouched in one of the chambers in the institution. Documents regarding Abnormality-37 was left, but not much was written about Abnormality-37. Due to the difficulties of transporting Abnormality-37, the entity has not been moved to the facility. A small outpost in the institution has been erected to monitor Abnormality-37. Testing must all be done in the institution where the entity is located.
