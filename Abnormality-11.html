        Desciption
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-11 is a naval vessel resembling a submarine. Abnormality-11 has a model that is not of any man-made submarine. Abnormality-11 resides at the Atlantic Ocean. Abnormality-11 does not need to surface, nor does it ever run out of supplies such as ammunition or fuel. Abnormality-11 is semi-hostile. Any vessel with armaments entering Abnormality-11's territory will be attacked by Abnormality-11 immediately with torpedoes. However, vessels without any weaponry will be completely ignored. Abnormality-11 always stays in one place, except when a dangerous vessel intrudes its territory. Abnormality-11 ignores any communication attempt by anyone. The area of Abnormality-11's territory has been closed off with international agreement.

        Incidents

      <h3>
        Incident 11-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        A cargo ship entered Abnormality-11's territory was attacked by Abnormality-11. The incident caused publicity and almost revealed the existence of abnormalities and the organization to the general public. With the cooperation of several countries, the incident was covered up. After investigation, said cargo ship contained several black market weapons. It is unknown if the black market weapons were the cause of Abnormality-11's attack.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 11-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A ship was sinking in Abnormality-11's territory due to collision. The ship immediately called for help from any available vessel. A nearby military ship entered Abnormality-11's territory to aid in saving passengers and sailors. Peculiarly, Abnormality-11 did not attack the military ships and stayed put. Later, the ship was asked to re-enter Abnormality-11's territory. The ship was attacked, although not sunk.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 11-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Pirate ships entered Abnormality-11's territory in an attempt to raid a cargo ship. The pirates were sunk by Abnormality-11. News of the mysterious sinking garnered media attention. The media had to be suppressed to prevent the public from finding out about abnormalities. Warships from the marine department has been dispatched to prevent unauthorized entry to Abnormality-11's territory.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addenda 11-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It had been found out that Abnormality-11 registers any military weapon, whether that be aircraft, infantry guns, tanks, or even just ammunition as a target. Any ship containing any military weapons will be attacked by Abnormality-11 when they enter Abnormality-11's territory. If the weapons are disabled or no longer operational, Abnormality-11 won't register it as a target. Abnormality-11 seems to have a sense of self-preservation, as it has prevented all attempts to damage it. Additionally, Abnormality-11 never attacks a warship that is heading to save survivors from a shipwreck. However, if a warship enters its territory without any intention to save the survivors, the ship will be attacked by Abnormality-11 immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addenda 11-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A group of divers have been sent to infiltrate and investigate Abnormality-11. The hatch to enter Abnormality-11 was not locked or guarded in any way. The divers easily entered with no difficulties. Inside, the divers report that the submarine was dark but clean. The divers explored the entity for 10 minutes. A diver yelled seeing something. Gunshots were heard, and communications broke down. The divers did not return and it was impossible to reestablish communications. The divers did not bring any weapons due to Abnormality-11's nature, and it has been theorized that there are things residing inside Abnormality-11 that uses weaponry. Another team of divers have been sent, but met the same fate as the previous group. Permission to sent another group has been declined.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-11 suddenly appeared where it is now on 2013. It is unknown how it had suddenly appeared and how it was never detected until the first incident in which a military ship was sunk by Abnormality-11. It is unclear at which date exactly the entity has first appeared. No nation has also claimed to be aware of Abnormality-11 before 2013.
