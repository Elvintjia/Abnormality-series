        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-10 is a slime with an approximate volume of 27000 litre. Abnormality-10 is sentient but aggressive. Abnormality-10 can eat anything organic regardless of what it is or how large it is. Abnormality-10 can use its shape to fit any hole. Anything with a small gap can be gone through by Abnormality-10. Abnormality-10 is a big eater and requires at least a daily consumption of 20 kilo calories. If it is not met, Abnormality-10 will attempt to break out. Entering Abnormality-10's containment room is strictly forbidden as Abnormality-10 eats humans and will do so if given the opportunity. Food is to be provided to Abnormality-10 everyday until the quota is met to prevent breakout incidents. Abnormality-10 is impervious to conventional weaponry. No known methods of eliminating Abnormality-10 exists. Abnormality-10 never increases its body mass.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 10-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        In test 10-5, Abnormality-10 obtained the ability to corrode metals and broke out of containment. Abnormality-10 seemed to be sentient enough to use its newly acquired ability to bypass facility security and even flank sentinels. Abnormality-10 was recaptured after it attacked and destroyed a village. Hereafter, chemicals are forbidden to be used in tests and experiments involving Abnormality-10.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 10-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Test 10-10 involves crushing Abnormality-10 with a piston. Unfortunately, Abnormality-10 multiplied itself to the point crushing it was impossible. Abnormality-10 increased in mass until the piston broke. Abnormality-10 reverted to its original size and immediately attempted escape, causing casualties and destruction. Requirements for test approval has been ramped up to prevent breakout incidents rooting from experiments.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 10-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        In test 10-13, Abnormality-10 obtained the ability to eat non-organic matters after consuming processed food. The effect caused Abnormality-10 to escape its containment room. Fortunately, Abnormality-10 lost its ability shortly after. Sentinels could contain Abnormality-10 before the entity escaped the facility.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Adde" class="Border">
        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 10-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-10 is completely invulnerable. Methods of elimination such as extreme heat, explosion, fire, freezing temperature, poison, acid, and even electrocution has little to no effect on Abnormality-10. However, a peculiar fact, Abnormality-10 seems to be able to move faster in hot conditions. Being burnt or extreme heat allows Abnormality-10 to move faster, even to the point of being capable of matching a racing car depending on the temperature. Additionally, Abnormality-10 has reduced mobility underwater. Therefore, Abnormality-10's containment room has been transformed to a water tank to help contain Abnormality-10. Lastly, chemicals are forbidden to be used in testing. See incident 10-1 for explanation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 10-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Due to the rising number of incidents caused by testing, all testing for Abnormality-10 has been suspended indefinitely. Abnormality-10 shows the capability of becoming stronger or weaker depending on environmental circumstance such as temperature, volume, etc. Abnormality-10 also shows intelligence to make use of its newly acquired abilities. Furthermore, Abnormality-10's danger level has been changed from level 3 to level 4 due to its unpredictability and its intelligence.
