        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-7 is a red coloured book measuring 10 cm Ã— 20 cm. The book has 200 pages, yet all of the pages are blank. Texts will randomly appear in Abnormality-7's pages. The text will note about something that will happen in the future. Any prophecy in Abnormality-7's pages will always come true, even to the last details. Texts in Abnormality-7's pages can never be erased. Tearing will cause the page to merge itself back onto the book whilst the person to tear the book will immediately have a stroke, but said person can still be saved with immediate medical care. So far, any attempts to prevent disasters or whatever has happened in the book has never succeeded. All prophecies are always written in English. All prophecy inside Abnormality-7 will disappear 48 hours after the prophecy has been fulfilled.

      <h3>
        Test 7-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An unrealistic but probable occurrence was written in Abnormality-7 to happen two days after writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The occurrence happened exactly as written in Abnormality-7.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Prophecies were written in Abnormality-7 without an exact date of the prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: All prophecies happened exactly 72 hours after the writing.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A doodle was drawn in Abnormality-7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The doodle disappeared automatically.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A prophecy was written in Abnormality-7 with a pencil. The prophecy would then be erased with an eraser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The eraser couldn't erase the written prophecy.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A paragraph that is not a prophecy was written in Abnormality-7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The paragraph disappeared automatically. The time needed for the paragraph to fully disappear is roughly the same speed as the doodle in test 7-3.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Prophecies were written in Abnormality-7 but with other languages than English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: All written prophecies changed to English language 5 minutes after writing.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 7-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: The prophecy "A dead person will be alive again," was written in Abnormality-7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Gone horribly wrong. See incident 7-5 for explanation.

        Incidents

      <h3>
        Incident 7-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Professor Arnold had the idea of taking advantage of loopholes within prophecies in the book. In one prophecy, an earthquake will happen. There was a number of listed casualties. It was decided that human residents will be evacuated and replaced with animals to see if the book will register the animal's death and injury as casualties. It was a success. The animals' death was counted as casualties. Plans to make further use of loopholes are still being discussed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 7-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        During one of Abnormality-7's prophecy, a white coloured doll-like creature was spotted. It was unknown what it was doing, but it couldn't be found later after the prophecy was done. Similar sightings have been made in other prophecy sites of Abnormality-7. Further investigation into these white doll-like creatures are pending.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 7-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-7A was clearly seen by one sentinel, but could not be seen by civilians. A search for Abnormality-7A was conducted and three Abnormality-7As were found. However, present civilians seemed to be unaware of the presence of Abnormality-7A. When interviewed later, said civilians claimed there was nothing there, no Abnormality-7A. Further investigation is underway as to why Abnormality-7A could not be seen by civilians.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 7-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Professor Arnold tried writing on Abnormality-7 with a pen. He wrote, "Five people will go to the second floor bathroom simultaneously at 1700 hours." Later, security feed showed that indeed, five people went into the second floor bathroom at 1700 hours the same day. Tests to write on Abnormality-7A has been approved.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 7-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        In test 7-7, a dead person really came back to life. The person is henceforth referred as Abnormality-7B. Abnormality-7B is a very aggressive humanoid creature with brown skin pigment. Abnormality-7B killed 20 organization personnel before escaping. Abnormality-7B was neutralized but not before killing 8 sentinels and 29 civilians. Little is known regarding Abnormality-7B because immediate neutralization of Abnormality-7B was ordered.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 7-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        A forbidden test have been conducted. Staff member Mabel broke open the safe containing Abnormality-7 and wrote in Abnormality-7 regarding other Abnormalities. Staff member Mabel was apprehended, but the prophecy written in Abnormality-7 never came true. The written prophecy disappeared a few days after.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 7-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        After incident 7-1, casualties of natural disasters in Abnormality-7 will always have human casualties written. Loopholes used before have already disappeared. It is under debate if Abnormality-7 is actually sentient and learns from previous loopholes abuse. It is unknown how Abnormality-7 knows a loophole abuse has happened.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 7-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        After several investigations, it has been found that in every place where a prophecy by Abnormality-7 has happened, there will be white doll-like creatures, hereafter referred to as Abnormality-7A. Abnormality-7A will always appear in prophecy sites to make sure everything will happen as the prophecy in Abnormality-7. Any aggressive attempts have failed to injure Abnormality-7A. Attacked Abnormality-7A will become hostile and attack its attacker. So far, no attempts to kill Abnormality-7As have ever succeeded. Abnormality-7A is impervious to bullets, explosives, acid, and other conventional weaponry. The number of Abnormality-7A that appears on every prophecy site is always in proportion to the size of the prophecy. The bigger the prophecy, the more Abnormality-7A will appear. Abnormality-7A is very skilled in stealth, therefore, to detect one, many personnel will be needed in a search to the prophesied site. Abnormality-7A will automatically disappear after the prophecy has been completed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 7-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        After incident 7-3 an investigation has been conducted. It has been found that people with no knowledge of the prophecy happening or without knowledge of Abnormality-7 cannot see Abnomality-7A, thereby explaining why sightings of Abnormality-7A by non-organization personnel has never happened before.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 7-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        It was found out that Abnormality-7 can be written on and make what is written on the entity happen, regardless of how unrealistic or how impossible it is. Any non-prophecy written in Abnormality-7 will disappear in the course of 3 minutes. If a prophecy is written in any language other than English, Abnormality-7 will automatically translate the prophecy to English. Abnormality-7 is capable of giving birth to new Abnormalities by writing a prophecy. Therefore, testing have been stopped and Abnormality-7 is now locked in a thick safe due to how dangerous it is. Abnormality-7's alias has been changed to self-fulfilling prophecy due to Abnormality-7A's appearance to make sure every prophecy will happen as exactly written in Abnormality-7.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 7-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a speculation made by Professor Arnold. A question was raised as to why Abnormality-7 created a new abnormality, but couldn't change or do something about an abnormality in incident 7-6. Professor Arnold speculated that Abnormality-7 can change what is normal, but not what is not normal, meaning it can assist in the creation of new abnormalities, but can do nothing against already existing abnormalities. Test proposals have been submitted, but so far, all proposals have been denied. Considering how dangerous Abnormality-7 can be, it is unlikely that the proposal will be accepted. Furthermore, security on Abnormality-7 has been increased to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing Abnormality-7. Request to destroy Abnormality-7 is currently pending.
