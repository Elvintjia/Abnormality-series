        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-31 is a ring made from stainless steel. It's thickness is 30 mm with its diameter as 1.7 cm. When worn, Abnormality-31 will distort the wearer's common sense. The wearer won't necessarily commit immoral actions or commit crimes, but if any crimes or immoral acts were to happen in the wearer's vicinity, the wearer will simply ignore it. Additionally, any danger the wearer sees will also be ignored. If the wearer's hands are burning, there's a bomb in the building, or any other threat are present, the wearer will save himself, but won't be in a hurry or feel any worry. When the ring is taken off, the wearer's common sense will return. Holding or touching the ring will not distort the holder's common sense.

      <p>
        Result: Cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>

        Incident 31-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        During an experiment, an earthquake happened which resulted in part of the facility collapsing. The experimental subject wearing Abnormality-31 was buried under rubble and killed. It took several days to clear the rubble and find Abnormality-31. Additionally, due to the damage, Abnormality-31 received a slight bent. Abnormality-31 was tested and it did not lose its abnormal influence. Stricter experiment procedure must be employed to avoid damage on Abnormality-31 and to avoid the possibility of the entity going missing.

      <h3>
        Addendum 31-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that it does not matter in which finger Abnormality-31 is worn. As long as Abnormality-31 is worn on a finger, Abnormality-31's effect will manifest. Abnormality-31's effect will not manifest should the entity be worn on a person's toe as opposed to on a finger. A person's intelligence are not influenced when wearing Abnormality-31. It was also found out, that anyone wearing Abnormality-31 is also more prone to obeying strange or suicidal orders. Fear is suppressed when wearing Abnormality-31. Lastly, only humans are capable of being influenced by Abnormality-31.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-31 was found between the wrecks of a ghost ship. A ship ghost ship was washed away and ended in the coast of west Africa. Abnormality-31 was found in the wreckage and auctioned. Abnormality-31 changed hands nearly dozens of times. Abnormality-31's supernatural effects were first realized when the owner of the ring wore the ring and walked nude outside. Police arrested the individual, but the individual is completely confused why he was arrested. Subsequent investigations brought to light the existence of Abnormality-31. Local authority chose to give Abnormality-31 to the organization to take hold of.
