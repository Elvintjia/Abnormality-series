        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-20 is a giant 3 by 3 meter cubic safe colored black. Abnormality-20 has a rough thickness of 1.5 cm. Abnormality-20 is made from steel that is of very high quality. Abnormality-20 is very durable and will repair itself after being damaged. The method of repair is still unidentified. If an object is put within Abnormality-20 and Abnormality-20 is closed, the object put inside Abnormality-20 will switch position with a random object on Earth. There are no clear pattern as to what object will be switched if a certain object is put inside Abnormality-20. All objects that is switched will always be small enough to fit into Abnormality-20. Abnormality-20 can never be locked, despite being a safe. Abnormality-20 is extremely heavy, weighing 40 kg while being empty.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 20-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-20 suddenly disappeared from containment room. Camera feeds showed Abnormality-20 disappearing instantly without warning. Investigation to search for the whereabouts of Abnormality-20 was conducted. After a while, Abnormality-20 was found in a remote village in Africa. Abnormality-20 was recovered and information regarding the entity was covered up. Investigation to discover the trigger for Abnormality-20's disappearance is ongoing.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 20-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It was found that the candle from test 20-6 was transported to a library and caused a great fire. Most of the books in the library were burnt and two people died. Dozens others were injured. Watchmen had to plant fake evidences to hide the possibility of the public finding out about the abnormalities. Possibly dangerous objects are no longer allowed to be put in Abnormality-20.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 20-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined by investigation that the cause of incident 20-1 was caused due to lack of use of Abnormality-20 for a week. If Abnormality-20 isn't used for a week, the entity will teleport itself to a random location in the world. Therefore, Abnormality-20 must be used at least once every week. Additionally, in light of incident 20-2, no potentially dangerous object may be put inside Abnormality-20. Lastly, it has been found out that any animals put inside Abnormality-20 will disappear while only leaving a pool of blood. Where they go is unknown and has yet to be identified.
