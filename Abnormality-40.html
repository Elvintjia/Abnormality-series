	  Description
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-40 is a cylindrical plastic bottle measuring 22 cm in height and 7 cm in diameter. Any liquid that is poured into Abnormality-40 will have an amplified effect, regardless of whatever liquid is put inside. Poison can become more toxic when put inside Abnormality-40, and beer can contain more alcohol when put inside Abnormality-40. However, the effects Abnormality-40 is not always consistent. Water can be put inside and triple in volume or instead become absolutely pristine clean. As a result, it is impossible to be sure of what might happen when liquids are poured into Abnormality-40. Hence, the writing of addenda for Abnormality-40 is not yet authorized.

	  Origin
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-40 was obtained from a tribal shaman. The shaman had claimed that he had found a magical bottle. While he had shown it to people, people considered the magical part some kind of magician’s trick. No one believed it was truly magical. A watchman took a closer look at the bottle and realized there was no trick involved. Abnormality-40 was confiscated from the shaman. The shaman claimed to have imbued some kind of magic onto the bottle, but is unable to prove he did. The shaman is incapable of replicating the magic he claimed to have done to Abnormality-40.
