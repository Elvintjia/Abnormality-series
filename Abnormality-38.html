        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-38 is a former commando of the organization named Toby Crux. Abnormality-38 is invisible and seemingly non-existent to the average humans. It is impossible to hear or see Abnormality-38. Any sound Abnormality-38 makes or anything Abnormality-38 says cannot be heard. Any object worn or picked up by Abnormality-38 will also become invisible so long as the object is not bigger than Abnormality-38. However, if by any way a person hears about Abnormality-38 or the name Toby Crux, Abnormality-38 will become visible to the person. The person will be able to see Abnormality-38 and whatever object the entity is wearing or carrying, and hear whatever sound Abnormality-38 makes or Abnormality-38’s voice. The effect is permanent, so the person will be able to see Abnormality-38 again in the future. Additionally, Abnormality-38 seems to be ghost-like to people who cannot see Abnormality-38. Only people who can see Abnormality-38 can touch Abnormality-38. Abnormality-38 is essentially harmless and cannot do anything harmful, therefore Abnormality-38 has been given free roam of the facility. Abnormality-38 are also allowed regular outings away from the facility as long as a watchman is accompanying the entity and secrecy protocols are followed. Abnormality-38 may also visit his family occasionally. Abnormality-38 is 177 cm in height and 68 kg in weight.

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject claimed that words appeared on the piece of paper magically. Subject thought the paper was an abnormality.
      </p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-38 was ordered to shoot at an experimental subject that could not see the entity.

        Result: Subject died. It was observed that the bullet became visible to everyone only after the bullet has left the gun barrel.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject was told about Abnormality-38 as he was sitting where Abnormality-38 was sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject could not interact or see Abnormality-38 until subject stood up and and walked roughly 1 meter away from Abnormality-38.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject was ordered to pour water on Abnormality-38. The subject could not see Abnormality-38.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The water soaked Abnormality-38. Subject claimed the water disappeared by itself midair.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-38 was ordered to scream with a megaphone. An experimental subject who can’t see Abnormality-38 was in the room. A glass was also put inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject could not hear the scream. The glass was shattered.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-6A
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-38 was ordered to use a hand fan on an experimental subject that could not see the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject did not feel any cool wind coming from Abnormality-38.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject who could not see Abnormality-38 was ordered to poke at the entity with a stick. Subject was told to poke the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The stick could not touch Abnormality-38 and Abnormality-38 could not grab the stick. Only when the subject dropped the stick could Abnormality-38 pick it up.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-8
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A camera feed of Abnormality-38 was recorded. An experimental subject who could not see Abnormality-38 was ordered to watch it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject asked why he was ordered to watch a camera feed of an empty room.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-9
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-38’s recorded voice was played to an experimental subject who could not see Abnormality-38.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject felt like something could be heard, but not sure what it was. Similar experiments have similar results.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 38-10
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-38 was ordered to jump into a pool of water. Experimental subjects who could not see Abnormality-38 were ordered to observe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: There was a splash. Subjects who could not see Abnormality-38 thought the splash happened without any cause.
      </p>
      <h3 id="T1">
        Test 38-11
      </h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Notes: Hasn’t it been made clear that any objects Abnormality-38 holds in his hands will also become invisible?

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 38-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Junior staff members have reported cases where senior staff members were seen talking by themselves as well as instances of objects disappearing. This was frequently reported and caused temporary confusions. A great amount of misunderstanding was made and many juniors thought the abnormal occurrences were being ignored. Everything that happened was Abnormality-38 interacting with staff members and roaming around the facility. To avoid a repetition of such problems, every staff members in the facility containing Abnormality-38 has been informed of the entity except for experimental subjects.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 38-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been concluded that vague references or description of Abnormality-38 will not allow the listening person to hear or see Abnormality-38. Simply referring Abnormality-38 as someone without mentioning the entity’s name or designation is not enough to give the ordinary person the ability to see Abnormality-38. Any objects that are not touched directly by Abnormality-38 will always be visible. However, in the case that gloves are being used, any objects still on Abnormality-38’s hands will be invisible to the ordinary person. If a person who could not see Abnormality-38 is at or touching Abnormality-38, telling the person about Abnormality-38 will not allow the person to see or hear Abnormality-38. Only when the person has stopped touching Abnormality-38 or moved away, will the person be able to perceive Abnormality-38.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 38-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Water and liquid smeared on Abnormality-38 will appear to disappear to people who cannot see Abnormality-38. It would look as if the water disappeared midair. This causes Abnormality-38’s outline to be visible during rain. Outings must be monitored carefully to avoid rain and prevent possible information leak. It has also been concluded that it is not that the ordinary person cannot hear Abnormality-38. To be more precise, any vibrations in the air made by Abnormality-38 cannot be felt or detected by the ordinary people. Any screams or even actions that cause changes in the air that Abnormality-38 creates will be invisible to the ordinary person, no matter how big or possibly destructive it is. Additionally, Abnormality-38 is unable to take any objects held by someone who cannot perceive him.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 38-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been found out that Abnormality-38’s abnormal effects also influences camera feeds as well as voice recordings. Ordinary people are unable to see Abnormality-38 in camera feeds. Ordinary people are also unable to hear Abnormality-38’s voice recording, but will feel like something could be heard, yet will also be unsure what it is. Additionally, a large body of water will not become invisible to the ordinary people upon contact with Abnormality-38. Other liquids such as slime cannot become invisible upon contact with Abnormality-38’s body. Exceptions are when the small body of liquid is put on a container held by Abnormality-38 or is small in amount.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-38 came to be after a raid at one of the cult’s hideouts. Commandos engaged in a shootout against cultists. The cultists chose to burn their hideout and flee. Fortunately, commandos managed to put out the fire before it could spread or attract unwanted attention. The cult’s hideout contained only one abnormality, a single idol statue. Agent Toby Crux picked up the idol statue to transport it to the facility. It was only noticed after agent Toby Crux returns to the facility that the agent cannot be seen by some staff members. After a thorough investigation, Agent Toby Crux was declared an abnormality. The idol statue no longer affects any person touching it.
