        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-5 is an antique gramophone from 19th century. Abnormality-5 can play music even without a vinyl record. The music played will change every time with no clear pattern as to which song will be played. Anyone listening to the music will be inclined to stay and listen to the music. Anyone listening to the music will not willingly stop listening to the music unless interrupted or the music stops playing. First ten minutes of listening has no effect on the people listening. Ten minutes to twenty minutes of listening will cause listeners to refuse to stop listening unless forced by others or emergencies happening. Twenty minutes to thirty minutes, listeners cannot be stopped from listening to Abnormality-5 even after being forced by others. More than thirty minutes of listening will cause listeners to be inclined to stop listening to the music and leave. Listeners who have listened to Abnormality-5 will henceforth be referred to as Abnormality-5A. If Abnormality-5A listen to any song, Abnormality-5A will consider the songs bad or tone deaf, even to songs they previously liked. The abnormal effects on Abnormality-5A has never faded and to date, no Abnormality-5A have lost their inability to enjoy music.

      <h3>
        Test 5-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-5A was asked to listen to the same song he heard when he listened to Abnormality-5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-5A remarked that the music is bad and tone deaf.

      <h3>
        Test 5-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject capable of playing music was asked to listen to Abnormality-5. Said experimental subject, now Abnormality-5A, was asked to play music on an instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-5A could still play music, but remarked that he didn't feel satisfied with the result.

        Incident 5-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member Diana's earmuffs were not worn properly. As such, staff member Diana became entranced with Abnormality-5's song. Staff member Diana took off her earmuffs and listened to the song. Other staff members entered to get staff member Diana out. Unfortunately, their attempts were in vain as staff member Diana insisted on staying. Sentinels were called to forcefully get staff member Diana out. Even sentinels were unable to force her to stop listening. Staff member Diana showed impressive strength exceeding that of an average human. Sentinels dragging her away was thrown across the room. One sentinel accidentally hit Abnormality-5, causing the gramophone to stop playing. Immediately after, staff member Diana stopped struggling and realized what she was doing. She apologized and willingly took punishment for the incident. Later, doctor's diagnosis showed nothing wrong with staff member Diana, even though Diana seemingly had super strength. Staff member Diana also retained her ability to continue enjoying music and didn't become Abnormality-5A. Further investigation needs to be done to confirm super strength effects of Abnormality-5 on humans.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 5-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the preparation for test 5-18, Abnormality-5A stole an earmuff from a staff member whilst another staff member activated Abnormality-5's music. Abnormality-5A claimed he could still hear the music despite wearing the earmuffs. Abnormality-5A was frightened and started crying, begging for the music to stop. The music was stopped and Abnormality-5A was crying on the floor. Test 5-18 proceeded, despite Abnormality-5A's cry and plea.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 5-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Tests so far have indicated that Abnormality-5 will force people to continue listening at the music once said people have listened more than twenty minutes. People who have listened more than twenty minutes will gain superpowers to continue listening. Abnormality-5A can still enjoy music from Abnormality-5, but not from other sources. Test to try and see what happens when a person listens to Abnormality-5's music more than thirty minutes are currently pending. Abnormality-5's music can be listened to indirectly through speakers without having to worry of side effects. Abnormality-5's music can also influence animals as effectively as humans are.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 5-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        After a series of tests, it has been determined that listening to Abnormality-5's music more than thirty minutes is very dangerous. Forty minutes of listening will cause Abnormality-5A to hate music and destroy music sources whenever possible. If not possible, Abnormality-5A will bang his head to the wall. Peculiarly, Abnormality-5A won't bother to turn off Abnormality-5's music, even if it's possible and not forbidden. Listening for fifty minutes will cause Abnormality-5A to become deaf, unable to hear anything. Exposing said Abnormality-5A to Abnormality-5's music will cause Abnormality-5A to stop breathing and die shortly after, even if the music is stopped before Abnormality-5A dies. Exposure to Abnormality-5A's music for more than sixty minutes will cause Abnormality-5A to lose blood from the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. Stopping Abnormality-5's music will not stop the bleeding.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 5-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        With earmuffs, any human and Abnormality-5A with thirty minutes of exposure cannot hear Abnormality-5's music. However, Abnormality-5A's with forty minutes of exposure or more seem to be able to hear and are still influenced by the music even with earmuffs. Abnormality-5A with thirty minutes of exposure also can listen to Abnormality-5's music without any notable consequence.
