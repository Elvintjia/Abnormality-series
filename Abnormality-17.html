          Description
        </h2>
        <p>
          Abnormality-17 is a yellow handheld device with a screen and nothing else. The display in Abnormality-17's screen is different based on whoever is holding the entity. If recently, the person holding Abnormality-17 has committed a bad deed, the device will show what the person can do to rectify his bad deed. Abnormality-17 will also show the consequence of the bad deed the person has committed if said person does not rectify his mistake. If the person holding Abnormality-17 has committed a good deed recently or has just rectified his previous bad deed, Abnormality-17 will show what other good deeds the person can do immediately or soon. Abnormality-17 will not in anyway compel anyone holding the entity. The person holding Abnormality-17 can simply ignore Abnormality-17 and nothing will happen. However, consequence from bad deeds will happen with a 100% guarantee. No matter how unlikely. Abnormality-17's display is normally written in Spanish. Abnormality-17 is plastic apart from its screen.

          Incident 17-1
        </h3>
        <p>
          A forbidden test was conducted to another abnormality. Unfortunately, it was difficult to determine the person responsible for the forbidden test. Professor Sebastian suggested that Abnormality-17 was used to determine who conducted the forbidden experiment. The suggestion was approved and the suspect was determined very quickly. Suggestion to use Abnormality-17 to determine people responsible for forbidden tests, sabotage, or possible espionage has been approved.
        </p>

          Addendum 17-1
        </h3>
        <p>
          People who received advice from Abnormality-17 to do a good deed will feel nice and fuzzy after doing the good deed. The people will feel more inclined to do good deeds, even if there are no incentives. Another use for Abnormality-17 was found. Abnormality-17 can be used to find out whoever had just committed a bad deed. See incident 17-1 for explanation. Ergo, Abnormality-17 is allowed to be used to determine the culprit to sabotage, espionage, forbidden experiments, and the likes.

        <h2 id="Orig" class="Border">
          Origin
        </h2>
        <p>
          Abnormality-17 was obtained from a death cult's hideout. The agency and the organization worked together in order to infiltrate and secure abnormalities. In the process, several cult members were arrested and some were shot dead due to resistance, or due to suicide. Abnormality-17 was found within a locked room inside the hideout, where the cult leader stores ritual tools. After a brief discussion between on site personnel, Abnormality-17 fell to the organization's hands, because one of the agency's agent said, "The agency has no use for such a useless tool."
