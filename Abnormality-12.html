        Incident 12-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        An uncooperative experimental subject tore a page out of Abnormality-12. The page was glued back to Abnormality-12, but when another experimental subject read the previously torn page, no effect on the subject's beliefs were recorded. It has been theorized that torn pages from Abnormality-12 will lose its ability to influence a person's beliefs. Unfortunately, permission for testing has been repeatedly declined.

        Addendum 12-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-12 can and will only influence a person's beliefs. Religion and ideological beliefs can be changed by Abnormality-12, however sanity and emotional will stay uninfluenced. Abnormality-12's influence are life-long and will never dissipate. People with no concept of beliefs, such as the young or mentally impaired, cannot be influenced by Abnormality-12. Additionally, if pages that are torn from Abnormality-12 are read, the reading person will be uninfluenced.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-12 was found in an abandoned agency facility. The agency abandoned the facility after a breakout incident occurring and opted to quarantine the location. After the threat has been neutralized, the agency chose to move the personnel and material elsewhere because the facility is too damaged to be operational and repairs would be too expensive. After that, commandos entered the facility to investigate available information. Most documents have either been destroyed, or brought back with the agency. However, some documents and Abnormality-12 was left behind, because the room which was their location was blocked off by debris and required heavy equipment to remove. The agency are unaware that the organization holds this abnormality, and it should be kept secret as much as possible.
