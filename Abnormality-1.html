        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-1 is a man named Daniel Durwitz. He is a Caucasian male with brown hair and blue eyes. His height around 179 cm and his weight approximately 76 kg. His alias name by the organization is Schizophrenia. Abnormality-1 will seem like an ordinary man at first glance, but upon further inspection, Abnormality-1 has the mental impairment schizophrenia. The schizophrenia however, seems to have no effect on Abnormality-1's actions. He is still capable of acting like a normal human does. However, Abnormality-1's powers only manifests when danger is present. Abnormality-1 was found after a breakout incident causing mass casualties on a town. Abnormality-1 was the only survivor to escape completely unharmed. Camera footage shows that Abnormality-1 was purposefully avoiding spots that are either dangerous, or may cause harm. Abnormality-1's vision will show some kind of warning to Abnormality-1 that someplace or something is dangerous, hence Abnormality-1's ability to survive dangerous situations. Abnormality-1 is quite cowardly and will happily run away from danger instead of confronting them. The severity of Abnormality-1's schizophrenia is currently unknown, as psychologists have a hard time determining it. Accordingly, Abnormality-1 sees a very warped perception of the world and often hears strange and disturbing noises. Abnormality-1 poses no threat to humans, and so are given free roam of the facility.

      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe a photo given to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-1 could describe the image with great accuracy. Peculiarly, Abnormality-1 could describe colours in the picture whilst being unable to do so on other objects.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe a painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-1 could describe the painting down to the colours with great accuracy.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to differentiate dud grenades and working grenades from ten of them. All grenades are similar in size, weight, and shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-1 was capable of differentiating which grenade was a dud and which one was actually working grenade. Abnormality-1 requested that similar tests involving very dangerous things not to be carried out again.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe staff member Dorothy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-1's description was very different and warped compared to the staff member. However, the size and body shape's description was very accurate. Furthermore, the staff member's hair length and style could also be described with ease.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was shown a computer monitor and asked to describe what is shown on the screen.

      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-1 could describe the episode accurately.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-9
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe the horror he sees to a experimental subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Experimental subject became schizophrenic after 20 minutes of solid description given by Abnormality-1. Experimental subject's psychologist stated that the horror and insanity is beyond imagination. Suggestions have appeared to classify Abnormality-1's ability to stay sane despite the horror to be classified as part of abnormality.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 1-10
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe his horrors to an experimental subject. Said experimental subject was then asked to differentiate real and dud grenades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Experimental subject was capable of differentiating real and dud grenades, even though he initially couldn't.

        Test 1-11
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-1 was asked to describe his horrors to experimental subjects. Said subjects were then given psychiatric assistance and monitoring regularly with each subject having different intervals between assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subjects given psychiatric assistance at least once every 48 hours did not commit suicide. Subjects given psychiatric assistance once every more than 48 hours committed suicide. Schizophrenic vision disappeared from the subject after 2 weeks or so.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 1-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-1 was walking around the facility to go to the canteen and eat. Abnormality-1 reached an elevator yet refused to get on it. Abnormality-1 proceeded to warn everyone else that the elevator is unsafe. After staff members inspected the elevator, it was found that the elevator had a broken module and would cause death on its 4th use after Abnormality-1's warning. This incident has brought about the idea of using Abnormality-1 to check the safety of equipment by having him take a look at them.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 1-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Jason asked Abnormality-1 to describe his horrors in great details to him. Abnormality-1 complied and gave a solid description of the horror he sees on a daily basis. After a solid 20 minutes of listening, Dr. Jason became insane. Analysis shows that Dr. Jason became schizophrenic. Dr. Jason described the experience as very terrifying and mind-breaking. 55 hours after first becoming schizophrenic, Dr. Jason committed suicide. Further investigation is required to inspect if Abnormality-1 is cause of Dr. Jason's schizophrenic change.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 1-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        In one test, an experimental subject was subjected to listening a recording of Abnormality-1's description of his horror. Said subject did not become schizophrenic. Investigation has showed that said subject has already become schizophrenic before by listening to the same tape. Further investigation is needed to determine whether listening to the same recording after becoming schizophrenic by the same recording can still cause schizophrenia.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 1-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        During a breakout incident, several staff members came to Abnormality-1's room to hide as Abnormality-1 is very friendly and can cause no harm. After sentinels took too long to arrive, Abnormality-1 led the group of staff members out of the facility without a single casualty. The group was later found in the front entrance, waiting for rescue to arrive. Abnormality-1 led 9 staff members plus another 7 staff member met on the way to safety. A staff member has requested that Abnormality-1A be used for search and rescue missions or to be used by staff in the case of a breakout incident. Request is still pending.

      <h2 class="Border" id ="Adde">
        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 1-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Testings have shown that Abnormality-1's schizophrenia has no effect on texts, images, and electronic screens. Image extends to paintings and even random sketches on paper. Reason for this is still under investigation. So far, Abnormality-1 has been confirmed to see these aspects of objects in a different way from others: Texture and colour. Abnormality-1 sees these aspects of objects the same way as others do: Shape and size.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 1-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        After incident 1-2, more tests were done to determine the extend of Abnormality-1's capability to share his abilities to others. Abnormality-1 is capable of sharing his danger sensory ability by describing his horror to other people. People who listen to his descriptions for a solid 20 minutes, regardless whether they paid attention or not, will become schizophrenic and obtain Abnormality-1's danger sensory ability. These people will from here on out be called Abnormality-1A. Abnormality-1A will kill themselves if not given psychiatric assistance every 48 hours due to the sheer horror of the schizophrenia. Abnormality-1 seems to have the same level of schizophrenic horror. Hence, Abnormality-1's ability to stay sane despite the horrors is also considered an abnormality. Abnormality-1A's ability will fade after approximately 2 weeks after first gaining the ability. Abnormality-1's power can be shared through recording, writing, or typed descriptions. Abnormality-1 is the only person with the ability to be able to share his powers. People who has read or listened to one description once cannot become schizophrenic again by reading or listening to the same description. Abnormality-1 is unable to share his ability to an average schizophrenic person.

      <h3>
        Interview 1-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Question: When did you start to have this power?
        <br>
        Answer: I think I've been like this ever since I was born.
        <br>
        Question: Does anyone besides us know about your powers? If they do, what do they think of it?
        <br>
        Answer: My late mother and father knew about it. They were horrified to think I was living in such a state. They brought me to psychiatrists to cure me, but nothing worked.
        <br>
        Question: Did they give up on curing you?
        <br>
        Answer: Yes. It took some convincing, but they finally gave in. I told them I could still grow up as a normal person would.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Interview 1-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Question: How can you tell that something dangerous is about to happen?
        <br>
        Answer: Usually, there's a black figure standing somewhere where it is dangerous. The black figure can't be touched or seen by others, but it gives me the feeling of leaving the place as soon as possible.
        <br>
        Question: Can you describe the black figure?
        <br>
        Answer: It looks somewhat like a standing shadow. It is completely black. It has no facial features, and it gives off groans and voices of pain.
        <br>
        Question: Is it possible to converse with the creature?
        <br>
        Answer: That's impossible. I tried asking them, but they don't speak. They don't even have a mouth.
        <br>
        Question: Is that the only way to tell that there's a danger?
        <br>
        Answer: No. Occasionally, I also see signs or writings in the ceiling, floor, or the wall telling me where not to go.
