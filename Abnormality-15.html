          Description
        </h2>
        <p>
          Abnormality-15 is a pair of purple colored shoes for women. Abnormality-15 will strongly compel any women close to Abnormality-15 to wear them. Men are completely unaffected. If any women were to wear Abnormality-15, Abnormality-15 will cause decapitation of the person wearing it by unknown means. The body will still be able to move and act, even if the head is no longer attached. No blood will come out of the neck. Abnormality-15 will temporarily stop compelling women to wear the entity. The person wearing Abnormality-15, designated Abnormality-15A, will look for a mirror and then pose in front of it. Abnormality-15A is harmless and passive unless provoked. If left alone for three hours, Abnormality-15A will take off Abnormality-15, and then fall down. Abnormality-15 will compel women to wear it once more, and Abnormality-15A will start bleeding from the neck.

        <h3>
          Test 15-1
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Abnormality-15 was worn by an experimental subject. No mirrors was put in the vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Abnormality-15A continuously looked for a mirror. Three hours after, Abnormality-15A took off Abnormality-15 and died.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-2
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Two female experimental subjects were put in Abnormality-15, containment room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: One of the experimental subject wore Abnormality-15 before the others could. The other experimental subject said she no longer felt she wanted to wear Abnormality-15 after the then Abnormality-15A wore Abnormality-15.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-3
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Communication was attempted with Abnormality-15A.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Abnormality-15A could communicate with hand gestures, but rarely reacts to communication attempts.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-4
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: An experimental subject was ordered to shoot at Abnormality-15A with a gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Abnormality-15A reacted by grabbing the nearest item as a weapon and attacked the subject. The subject died. Abnormality-15A was riddled with bullets, but is still capable of movement and violence.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-5
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: An Abnormality-15A was put on fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Abnormality-15A ignored the fire, even though the fire was clearly burning its flesh. Soon after, Abnormality-15A took off Abnormality-15 and then died.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-6
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: A male experimental subject was ordered to wear Abnormality-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Twenty male subjects were brought in, but none of the subjects could get the shoes to fit in their feet. Previously recorded female subjects never encounter this problem.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-7
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: A female experimental subject wearing boots locked in so that it couldn't be taken off by the subject was ordered to get close to Abnormality-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: The subject attempted to get the boots off, but ultimately couldn't. The subject did not wear Abnormality-15. Sparked incident 15-1.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-8
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: A female experimental subject was put inside a glass cage and Abnormality-15 was put just outside the cage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: The female experimental subject tried but couldn't get Abnormality-15. When a male experimental subject was ordered to take away Abnormality-15, the female experimental subject broke from the cage and took Abnormality-15 from the male experimental subject's hands.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-9
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: A female experimental subject was put inside a room. A box with Abnormality-15 inside was sent inside the room. The subject was ordered not to open the box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: The subject ignored the order and opened the box, wearing Abnormality-15 immediately after. Subject seemed to have know Abnormality-15 was inside the box.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-10
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Nails were put within Abnormality-15. A female experimental subject was put in Abnormality-15's containment room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: The subject wore Abnormality-15 and became an Abnormality-15A. The nails didn't seem to affect the Abnormality-15A in anyway. After three hours and the Abnormality-15A died, the nails in Abnormality-15 was found to be bloodied. Holes made by the nails in Abnormality-15A's feet were found.
        </p>

          Test 15-11
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Abnormality-15 was put near a legless experimental subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Subject was attracted to Abnormality-15, but couldnâ€™t put it on. When Abnormality-15 was taken away, subject did not react.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-12
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: Abnormality-15 was put near a female monkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: The female monkey is completely uninfluenced by Abnormality-15.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Test 15-13
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experiment: A female experimental subject was only given one shoe of Abnormality-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: Subject wore the one shoe and became Abnormality-15A. The Abnormality-15A then proceeded to get to the other shoe of Abnormality-15. Locked doors were not enough to stop the Abnormality-15A. Abnormality-15A managed to wear the other shoe of Abnormality-15A and assumed normal Abnormality-15A behavior.

          Incidents
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Incident 15-1
        </h3>
        <p>
          After test 15-7, a staff went into testing chambers to take away and keep Abnormality-15 for safekeeping. The experimental subject, however, refused to allow the staff member to take Abnormality-15. Sentinels were called in to take Abnormality-15 forcefully. However, when Abnormality-15 was about to be forcefully taken, the subject forcefully ripped the boots she was wearing and wore Abnormality-15. Subject turned into Abnormality-15A and behaved as how Abnormality-15A would.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Incident 15-2
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the process of preparation for test 15-9, the staff member carrying Abnormality-15 passed through a female staff member. The female staff member then took Abnormality-15 from the staff member's hand and wore it. The test had to be delayed for several hours. To avoid similar incidents, Abnormality-15 can only be tested close to its containment room.
        </p>

          Addenda
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Addendum 15-1
        </h3>
        <p>
          If no mirror is present, Abnormality-15A will continually search for a mirror, until the time limit is out. Abnormality-15A is capable of some degree of communication. It however, rarely reacts to communication attempt and in the rare case it does react to communication attempt, it will often only react for a moment before reverting to its usual behavior. Abnormality-15A cannot be killed by bullets or physical injuries. Even if organs and body parts are damaged, Abnormality-15A will still be able to move. Abnormality-15A will react aggressively against attackers. Abnormality-15's radius of influence has been determined to be 3 meters.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Addendum 15-2
        </h3>
        <p>
          It has been concluded that once a female has been compelled by Abnormality-15 to wear it, nothing can be done to stop the female. If the female is unable to wear Abnormality-15 at first, taking Abnormality-15 away will cause the female to take Abnormality-15 back forcefully and wear it. Males are completely incapable of wearing Abnormality-15. Additionally, if fire is inflicted upon Abnormality-15A, Abnormality-15A would take off Abnormality-15 and then die.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Orig" class="Border">
          Origin
        </h2>
        <p>
          Abnormality-15 was found inside a room of an old apartment. Inside the room, a cracked mirror stood. At least 12 headless corpses and 12 heads were found inside the room. Dried blood was stained everywhere on the floor. The apartment owner called the police after noticing people entering the room but not exiting it. Police took custody of the abnormality, but couldn't make heads or tails over the entity. In the end, Abnormality-15 was given to the organization to investigate.
