	  Description
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-42 is a wind up jack-in-the-box, but with a humanoid entity appearing instead of a jester when it is winded up. The humanoid entity names itself as Blake and has the appearance of a human male of around 30 years of age. The humanoid entity is designated as Abnormality-42B. Abnormality-42B is friendly and likes to give advice to people of trouble or teach, but dislikes being disturbed. If Abnormality-42 is winded up in the evening, at dawn, or multiple times within a short span of time, Abnormality-42B will open the box and kill the person winding up the box. Methods of murder includes, but is not limited to, stabbing, burning, beheading, poisoning, and clubbing. Abnormality-42B is knowledgeable in a lot of aspects in life and likes to give advice. Some advice has been shown to be effective, while some advice have been shown to be useless, but the advice rarely ever causes harm. Abnormality-42B does not need any sustenance, but the entity can be given food, which the entity will appreciate, though nothing beneficial will come out of it.

	  Addenda
	</h2>
	<h3>
	  Addendum 42-1
	</h3>
	<p>
	  It has been determined that despite the antisocial behavior of Abnormality-41, Abnormality-41 can still behave according to ordinary common sense. Abnormality-41 won’t approach people who are afraid of clowns and will explain his jokes when prompted. Incident 41-1 reveals that Abnormality-41 can be reasoned with and talked to, not bothering someone when asked politely. A new protocol has been put in place to avoid possible casualties by Abnormality-41. Abnormality-41 will explain jokes when prompted and leave after the person asking the joke understands or pretends to understand. Abnormality-41 has been determined to be unable to tell if someone is pretending not to understand the joke, therefore allowing an easier method of deceiving Abnormality-41 to avoid casualty. Recent tests have also shown Abnormality-41 to be invincible to conventional weaponry. However, more tests needs to be conducted to confirm the entity’s invincibility.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  Addendum 41-2
	</h3>
	<p>
	  Several attempts at interviewing Abnormality-42B have failed. Abnormality-42B would typically reenter Abnormality-42 when interviewed without answering any questions. Attempts to interview Abnormality-42 multiple times consecutively would result in Abnormality-42B becoming aggressive. It has also been found out that Abnormality-42B can teach certain subjects very well. Abnormality-42B can even produce books that does not exist in the world. Abnormality-42B can also show sudden or peculiar mastery over a subject temporarily when asked to teach something, but doesn’t exhibit the knowledge after the teaching. However, Abnormality-42B will produce textbooks and refuse to teach certain subjects such as mathematic, programming, and physics.

	  Origin
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-42 was found between the gifts for a child celebrating his birthday. When Abnormality-42 was found and winded up, Abnormality-42B appeared. The child was initially overjoyed, but the child kept winding up Abnormality-42 and caused Abnormality-42 to turn aggressive. Abnormality-42 caused multiple injuries and 2 deaths in total. Police confiscated Abnormality-42, and later put Abnormality-42 in the organization’s custody.
