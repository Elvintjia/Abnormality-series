        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-8 is a 2008 blue-colored telephone. Abnormality-8 looks like a normal telephone at a glance. Abnormality-8 cannot be used to call people. The number to call Abnormality-8 is not known, up until now. Occasionally, Abnormality-8 will ring. If Abnormality-8 is answered, a voice will speak and ask for a favour. The favour can range from something simple like telling what is 12 times 18, or something absurd like asking to talk to a specific person whose location is completely unknown. If the favour is declined, the voice will hang up. If the favour is accepted, the person accepting the favour must complete the favour within 20 hours. If the twenty hours limit is up but the favour is not done yet, the person accepting will lose one of these: Sense of sight, sense of sound, sense of smell, or sense of taste. There are no clear pattern which sensory will be lost. If the favour has been completed, Abnormality-8 will ring again. If the same person picks up the phone, the voice will congratulate the person and reward a gift to said person. Said person will get a random gift, ranging from useless items, to items said person desperately needs. The gift will always appear next to Abnormality-8 and is never harmful or dangerous. Abnormality-8 does not need electricity to ring, but will typically give easier favors when it is connected to electricity.

      <h3>
        Addendum 8-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        For some unknown reason, the voice in Abnormality-8 uses three as a basis number of everything. The voice is willing to give a specific reward if asked for, but will always give a favor of equal value to the asked reward. The specific reward will then appear after the favor is done and the voice have congratulated the asking person. If insisted thrice to be given a heavier favor than the reward is worth, the voice will give in and give a favor with heavier worth than the reward. When the reward is received, an additional reward will also appear for the asking person. In addition, the favor's reward can never expire. The reward will always be available after the favor is done. The voice seems to only be capable of giving material rewards.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-8 was first found in a civilian's house. Watchmen found out about it and Abnormality-8 was secured. The family living in the house claimed they did not know how or why the abnormality came to be. The mother of the family claimed she had bought the telephone from a store nearby and even had the receipt. The receipt was investigated, and it was a genuine one. However, upon visit to the store where Abnormality-8 was "bought" from, the staff claimed they never saw the mother of the family and the store didn't sell telephones. Camera showed that the mother of family indeed never visited the store and there was really no telephone sold in the store.
