        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-9 is a pair of individuals, one being a normal human while the other is the abnormality. Abnormality-9A is a knight with white armor and a white sword. Abnormality-9A is an entity which follows a specific person constantly. This specific person is Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A will make sure that Abnormality-9B will not die due to accidents or murder. Any harm done on purpose will never succeed. If someone attempts to kill or harm Abnormality-9B, Abnormality-9A will immediately kill whoever attempts the attack. Abnormality-9A can survive any injuries and regenerate any wound. It will throw itself in front of Abnormality-9B if it means saving Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A seems to possess sentience, but doesn't or can't speak. It can write or draw, but doesn't use it as a form of communication. If Abnormality-9B were to die out of sickness or suicide, Abnormality-9A will pick a nearby person as the next Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A does not have a clear pattern as to which person it will pick as the next Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A will keep himself invisible when in public, but will show itself when Abnormality-9B is endangered or if ordered to by Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A wields a sword, but it only appears when Abnormality-9B is threatened.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 9-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member Midori was the first female staff member to be Abnormality-9B. Staff member Midori complained that Abnormality-9A would enter the bathroom with her. Attempts to make Abnormality-9A not follow Abnormality-9B has failed so far. Abnormality-9A would follow Abnormality-9B no matter what. The problem was resolved after staff member Midori convinced Abnormality-9A to look away from her when she is in the bathroom.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 9-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        In one occasion, Abnormality-9B was in a bank that was being robbed. Abnormality-9B was about to be hit by one of the robbers, when Abnormality-9A intervened, breaking the robber's arm. Afterwards, every single one of the robbers was killed by Abnormality-9A. Police arrived, but by that time, all robbers have been slaughtered. The difficulty of covering up the incident has raised a discussion of forbidding Abnormality-9B to leave the organization's facility, to prevent similar incidents from happening.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 9-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        In test 9-10, a grenade was dropped to see what Abnormality-9A would do to protect Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A disassembled and disarmed the grenade in a matter of split second, preventing an explosion from happening. Afterwards, Abnormality-9A took a glance at some of the experiment's observers before going on a killing spree, killing everyone involved in the experiment save for Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A was scolded, but the entity seems unfazed by the warnings.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 9-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        A forbidden experiment was done. A staff member thought that it's possible to kill Abnormality-9B using an anti-materiel rifle, as the rifle could pierce through Abnormality-9A's body. The test result was surprising. The anti-materiel rifle's bullet was stopped by Abnormality-9A's body. It is unknown how the bullet could be stopped in this incident, while the bullet penetrated in test 9-12. Abnormality-9A proceeded to kill everyone involved in the forbidden experiment with the exception of Abnormality-9B.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 9-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Tests have been conducted to further understand Abnormality-9. So far, it has been concluded that no conventional method of harm can affect Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9A will prevent any harm from affecting Abnormality-9B. In addition, Abnormality-9A may kill the cause of harm depending on the severity of harm meant to be done. In light of this, further testing to Abnormality-9B is forbidden. Instead, tests have to be done directly to Abnormality-9A, as Abnormality-9A never retaliates unless Abnormality-9B is threatened.
      </p>

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-9A and the first recorded Abnormality-9B were first found in Russia. A hermit was found to be Abnormality-9B. The hermit had been living alone for quite a while, however, the hermit occasionally goes to a nearby town. For a long time, the hermit has kept the existence of Abnormality-9A a secret. However, an accident happened and Abnormality-9A showed itself to protect the hermit. Word by witnesses spread and watchmen heard about it. Commandos were sent to retrieve the abnormality. The hermit was cooperative, but Abnormality-9A refused to part with the hermit, so an agreement with the hermit was made. Organization personnel will be posted to observe and to prevent information leaks, but the hermit is free to do whatever he wished to do. After a few years, the hermit died from cancer, and Abnormality-9A chose a commando as Abnormality-9B. Abnormality-9B was then in the organization's containment.
