        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-23 is a free downloadable app in the internet. Abnormality-23 works like a virtual private network. However, its ability reaches abnormal levels. When Abnormality-23 is used, any browsing can never be tracked. IP address and any internet presence will vanish. It becomes absolutely impossible to track the device using this app, even with state-of-the-art technology. It is unknown who or what created Abnormality-23. Abnormality-23 takes zero storage space in the device and only has the simple interface of activation and deactivation. Abnormality-23 is hidden as much as possible from the public as well as other institutions and countries, as the potential for misuse can be high.

      <h3>
        Incident 23-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member Stefan activated Abnormality-23 while surfing the deep web to collect information. However, Staff member Stefan has left Abnormality-23 active and put his phone away. Later on, it was unknown where the phone had gone to, as calling the phone did not make it ring. It was found later after a fifteen minute search. Staff members are advised never to leave Abnormality-23 activated when the phone is not in use.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 23-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member Bernard turned on Abnormality-23 while surfing the web. The company owning the website he surfed at found out his suspicious activities because his surfing does not leave any cookies or any data. The company attempted to ban him, but it instead caused an error. After hours of attempts, the company gave up. The company informed other companies of a user with no cookies or data that can be collected. It became a huge commotion amongst digital security companies and web companies. After realizing the mistake, the organization went and cleared the misunderstanding. Abnormality-23 is no longer allowed to be used for personal use.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 23-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        After series of tests, it was found out that devices with Abnormality-23 activated cannot in any way be tracked. All account used when Abnormality-23 is active will be replaced with a non-existent anonymous account. Hackers or web companies are completely unable to track or detect the account. Permission has been given for Abnormality-23 to be used when gathering information in the web or hacking, as it is a very effective VPN.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 23-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        In light of incident 23-1, all personnel are advised never to leave Abnormality-23 active when their device isn't being used. This is because all communication to the device becomes impossible when Abnormality-23 is active. All communication from a device when Abnormality-23 is active will always be replaced with an anonymous. Additionally, devices with Abnormality-23 active do not emit radio signals. Phones can be used on aeroplanes without any problem so long as Abnormality-23 is active.
