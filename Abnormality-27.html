        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-27 is a seemingly inconspicuous ink blot on a 20 by 20 cm piece of paper resembling a butterfly. When seen by a person, the person's body will become blacker and blacker until it is pitch black. The pitch black person will hereafter be referred to as Abnormality-27A. When Abnormality-27A is seen by other people, the other people's eye will hurt. If left long enough, Abnormality-27A can cause colorblindness or at worst, blindness. Abnormality-27's effects are permanent. No known method can revert Abnormality-27A back to a normal human.

        Incident 27-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        During preparation for a test, staff member Nelly and Stefan touched Abnormality-27 directly. Staff member Nelly became Abnormality-27A immediately. The test had to be cancelled, and the incident investigated. Only staff member Kelly turned into Abnormality-27, despite staff member Stefan having done the same thing. Further investigation is underway. A strict rule to always touch Abnormality-27 with gloves has been placed. Exceptions when a test is conducted.

      <h3>
        Incident 27-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A cockroach had wandered into Abnormality-27’s containment room. Later, when an experiment was planned to be implemented, the cockroach had touched Abnormality-27 and turned black. The cockroach had escaped view and wandered out of the containment room into the facility. Once the cockroach was noticed, the alarm was sounded. The cockroach could cause unwanted accidents were it to leave the facility. After a few hours of searching and lockdown, the cockroach was found and disposed. Stricter protocols and security is necessary to prevent any kind of animals from entering Abnormality-27.

      <h3>
        Addendum 27-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It takes 4 minutes of solid staring at Abnormality-27 for a person to become an Abnormality-27A. If Abnormality-27A is stared at less than 4 minutes, the staring person's skin will become black, but it will return to its former color with time. The staring person will not become an Abnormality-27A. Staring at Abnormality-27 more than 4 minutes will have no effect on the staring person apart from becoming an Abnormality-27A. Bleach can be used to turn an Abnormality-27A's color into white. However, the bleached Abnormality-27A will still hurt whoever is staring at it. Touching Abnormality-27 directly will turn whoever touches the entity into an Abnormality-27A immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 27-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It was found out that albino people can stare at or directly touch Abnormality-27 without becoming Abnormality-27A, explaining why staff member Stefan didn't become an Abnormality-27A despite touching Abnormality-27 directly. People with white painted skins will still become Abnormality-27A if they touch or stare at Abnormality-27. People with white pigment injected into the skin can avoid turning into Abnormality-27A, but it requires the white pigment injected into the entire body. If only a handful of the skin is injected with white pigment, the person can still become Abnormality-27A, albeit the skin with white pigment staying white.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 27-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        An Abnormality-27A cannot be affected by Abnormality-27 anymore. Once a person becomes an Abnormality-27A, staring or touching Abnormality-27 will no longer have any effects. White pigments are unable to revert an Abnormality-27A back to a normal human. The Abnormality-27A's skin may become white, but can still cause eye damage to other people. The white pigments are permanent. Touching Abnormality-27 will not in any way cause the white colored skin to become black.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 27-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-27A's are immune to eye damage caused by staring at Abnormality-27A. In addition, photographs of an Abnormality-27A cannot cause eye damage, but a video of the entity can. Staring at Abnormality-27's photograph can cause a person to become an Abnormality-27A, but staring at the video won't. In addition, touching Abnormality-27A's will cause the touching person's skin to turn black. Given enough time, the blackness will spread to the person's entire body. The person will not become Abnormality-27A. The blackness will fade once the person stop touching the Abnormality-27A.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-27 was found between a dead psychology professor's documents in a British university. The late professor's colleague claimed to have seen the psychology professor make Abnormality-27 in his spare time. The colleague claimed to have helped in the process of making it, but does not know how it became an abnormality. Camera feed of the university proved the colleague's statement. At the time of the making, the ink blot could not yet turn people into Abnormality-27A. It is unknown when the ink blot became an abnormality.
