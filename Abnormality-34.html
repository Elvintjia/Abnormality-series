        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-34 is an Asian woman measuring 160 cm and weighing 58 kg. Abnormality-34 has a large affinity with plants. Abnormality-34 is capable of influencing plants in several different ways, such as reviving withered plants, quickening plants’ growth speed, and the likes. Abnormality-34 also has the effect of causing flowers to bloom and causing lands to become fertile wherever the entity is. Abnormality-34 has a crown of flowers growing on the entity’s head. The flowers on Abnormality-34 release pollen frequently and often cause dizziness to a regular human. Abnormality-34 is immune to the effects of the flowers’ pollen. Abnormality-34 is otherwise harmless and friendly. Abnormality-34 is cooperative and understanding with staff members. Hence, Abnormality-34 is given limited free roam of the facility.

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The bee suffered no ill effects. The beehive produced more honey than the usual. It was also noticed that the bees could somehow survive stinging more than once. After the flower was removed, the beehive’s honey production reverted and the bees could only sting once before dying.

        Incidents

      <h3>
        Incident 34-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        During a testing in a nearby room, a fire had occurred. The sprinklers activated to put out the fire. Abnormality-34 and the entity’s plants were nearby. After the fire was put out, it was found Abnormality-34’s containment room was filled with pollen and some of the flowers on Abnormality-34’s flower crown has cut itself off. Oxygen had reacted with the pollen, causing a lack of oxygen in the containment room. Abnormality-34 is completely unaffected by the pollen and the lack of oxygen. The pollen was later collected and the containment room was returned to its previous state. Professor Madya has hypothesized this incident was a self-defense mechanism against fire. Oxygen is deprived and the flammable flower crown cuts itself off so as not to catch on fire. It is unknown how Abnormality-34 could survive without oxygen. Further investigation is required. Abnormality-34’s flower crown completely regrew after a week.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 34-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-34’s affinity with flora allows the entity to largely influence plants near the entity. Anything planted by, or any plants near Abnormality-34 will experience massive growth speed. However, it has been determined that each species of plants will experience different levels of growth spurt. It is unclear what decides which plants experience better growth when close to Abnormality-34. Abnormality-34 can also cause a plant to grow somewhere they can’t grow due to environmental conditions. As long as Abnormality-34 is nearby and the plants receive their basic needs such as a planting medium, the plants will grow. Fungi are not affected by Abnormality-34. Additionally, if one of the flowers on Abnormality-34’s flower crown is cut, the flower will regrow within a week, albeit having different color and a different species.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 34-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        More information has been shed on Abnormality-34’s flower crown. Any flowers taken from Abnormality-34’s flower crown and then planted will continually bloom regardless of sunlight exposure or any other factors. It was also noticed that the soil the flower is planted on will become fertile. The planted flowers will also exude less pollen with less effects than the flowers still attached to Abnormality-34’s flower crowns. The flowers taken from Abnormality-34’s flower crown will continue to bloom and make soils fertile for two months, after which the flower will wither and the soil will stop receiving nutrition. Small scale shipments of flowers for sponsoring nations have been approved. Only several flowers from Abnormality-34’s flower crown may be taken within a single week so as not to cause stress or give long term effects on the entity.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 34-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiments has been made to learn more regarding the pollen produced from Abnormality-34’s flower crown. Inhaling Abnormality-34’s flower crown’s pollen would cause slight dizziness, but inhaling the pollen several times will cause hallucination and nausea. Inhaling it continuously will worsen the hallucination and nausea, before eventually the person inhaling will faint. The longer a person inhales the pollen, the longer the time required for recovery. Flowers taken from the flower crown and planted somewhere will exude pollen as well, but the effects are not severe enough to cause any more than dizziness. Additionally, bees benefit greatly from the planted flowers from the flower crown. Beehives could produce more honey and bees would be able to sting more than once before dying should they interact with the planted flowers from the flower crown.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 34-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        During an incident, it was found out that Abnormality-34 has some sort of self-defense mechanism against fire. Should a fire be lighted nearby, Abnormality-34’s flower crown will release chemical substance that reacts with oxygen, causing a lack of oxygen at the entity’s immediate surroundings. Fire will die out due to a lack of oxygen, and people may die due to asphyxiation. Some of the flowers from the entity’s flower crown will also cut itself off, presumably to prevent Abnormality-34 from possibly catching fire. Abnormality-34 seems to be immune to the deprivation of oxygen. Tests have been able to recreate the phenomenon consistently. Further investigation is required.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-34 was found living in a desolate forest in Asia. A local reported a strangely quick growth of a sapling he had planted in the forest, resulting in the deployment of commandos. The commandos found Abnormality-34. The entity had lived alone in a forest cabin for years and had no outside contact. Near the cabin, two graves made of wood could be found. Abnormality-34 has confirmed the graves are the entity’s mother and father’s. A field of well tended orchards and other plants could be found nearby. Abnormality-34 had used the fruits of harvest for sustenance. Abnormality-34 has never gone to school or interacted with strangers before the organization found the entity. The entity has little to no social skills and has never had any education aside from what was taught by the entity’s late parents.
