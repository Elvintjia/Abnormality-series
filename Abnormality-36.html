        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-36 are two chairs of the same design designated as Abnormality-36A and Abnormality-36B. Abnormality-36A and Abnormality-36B are the same in all aspects. However, Abnormality-36’s oddity only appears when a person sits on either Abnormality-36A or Abnormality-36B. After sitting, the person will be unable to stand up. Any attempt to remove the person from one of Abnormality-36 will always fail. The only way to allow the person to leave one of the Abnormality-36 is to have another person sit on the other Abnormality-36. Once another person sits on the other Abnormality-36, the person initially sitting on Abnormality-36 will be able to stand up and leave. However, the other person on the other Abnormality-36 will become unable to stand and cannot be removed from the entity. Another person must sit on the empty seat of one of Abnormality-36 for the other person to leave. There are no known methods of allowing a person to leave Abnormality-36 without leaving another person on the other Abnormality-36. Abnormality-36 are made of plastic and each weights about 500 grams. Each has a height of 1.5 meter.

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The experimental subject sitting on Abnormality-36B could not stand up. The chimpanzee was not stuck to Abnormality-36A.

        Experiment: An experimental subject was ordered to sit on Abnormality-36A for an indefinite amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Nothing out of the ordinary was recorded. Subject was stuck to Abnormality-36A with nothing notable occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional notes: Do not repeat this kind of experiment again. Subject had to defecate and urinate while still sitting on Abnormality-36A. The experiment room had an unbearable smell.

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Subject was able to walk around while carrying Abnormality-36B. However, subject’s legs went limp after walking for a long time, rendering the subject incapable of walking any further.

        Addenda

      <h3>
        Addendum 36-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that the only way to have both Abnormality-36 be unseated is by killing whoever is still sitting on one of the Abnormality-36. The lifeless body can easily be removed from the entities. If more than one person shared a seat on one of the Abnormality-36, only one person will be stuck to one of the entities. Apes seem to be unaffected by Abnormality-36, but animals such as dogs can be affected by Abnormality-36. Additionally, only one person can be stuck to one of Abnormality-36 at a time. No two person can be stuck to Abnormality-36 and no person can be stuck to both Abnormality-36.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 36-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-36 have been deemed incapable of causing any problems and injuries. The only way Abnormality-36 can cause harm is by starving or causing dehydration to the person stuck to them. If the person stuck to Abnormality-36 chose to walk around while carrying one of the entities, the person’s legs will soon go limp after walking 32 steps. The person’s leg will stop being limp only after someone else sits on the other Abnormality-36. Additionally, putting something on one of Abnormality-36 and then sitting on it will cause the sitting person and the object put on the entity to become stuck. Both the person and the object will become unstuck if someone else sits on the other Abnormality-36.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-36 was first found within a carpenter’s workshop. The carpenter of the workshop claimed to have made Abnormality-36. The carpenter claimed to have the intention of creating an abnormality when he created Abnormality-36. He was willing to describe the method of creating Abnormality-36. He had said he figured out the method after having a dream about seeing a god. Attempts to produce more of Abnormality-36 has failed. Accordingly, the method of creation only works once. The carpenter willingly agreed to keep Abnormality-36 a secret. A watchman is assigned to monitor the carpenter.
