        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-25 is a seemingly blank canvas painting with only one color on its canvas, blue. Abnormality-25 is 40 cm in width and 60 cm in height. Abnormality-25 does not do anything, but can cause problems in its own way. Creatures such as animals and even abnormalities can appear from the inside of Abnormality-25. The creature is usually in good health and is slightly stronger and more durable than their real world counterparts. The creatures are always aggressive and will sought to kill any other living things they can kill in the vicinity. The creatures often cause problems and sometimes also cause breakout incidents. No known methods is capable of preventing Abnormality-24 from summoning the creatures. Platoons of commandos and sentinels are always on standby in the case a dangerous creature were to appear from Abnormality-25.

        Addendum 25-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been found out that a world exist within Abnormality-25. The world in Abnormality-25 is largely bizarre and changes every time it is entered. The world is largely empty, yet resembles Earth. Occasionally, animals can be encountered. The animals encountered are as tough as animals that sometimes appear from Abnormality-25. Communication equipment somehow works while within Abnormality-25. Any video recording equipment inside Abnormality-25 will deactivate itself. Photos taken within Abnormality-25 will always be blurry. Analysis of the dirt and sand collected from Abnormality-5 is still ongoing.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-25 was found in an art gallery, replacing one of the paintings. A creature came out just as the art gallery was about to be opened. The unit were sent to eliminate the creatures and deal with the mess. No information regarding how Abnormality-25 got to the gallery is known. Surviving staff member of the art gallery admitted to seeing the painting, but not knowing if it was supposed to be on display. The unit attempted to destroy Abnormality-25 by many means, including but not limited to burning and tearing. None of the attempts succeeded. Abnormality-25 was to be handed to the local government, but the local government was unwilling to take in such a dangerous abnormality. Hence, Abnormality-25 was given to the organization.
