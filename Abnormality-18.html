        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-18 is a race of giant lobsters. The adult lobster is 1.5 meters long and weighs up to 468 kg. Every Abnormality-18 is aggressive but also territorial. Abnormality-18 ignores any humans outside of its territory when not hunting. Caution is still necessary. When hunting, Abnormality-18 will attack any creature regardless of location. Abnormality-18 are sexless. Each Abnormality-18 can lay eggs. An Abnormality-18 grows in a very slow time, requiring over 20 years to mature. After maturing, the entities will lay as much eggs as possible before dying in 5 years. Abnormality-18 are omnivores, but prefers meat over non-meat. Abnormality-18's carapace is very hard, enough to deflect bullets yet flexible. Abnormality-18 has very strong claws and long antennas.

      <h3>
        Test 18-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A machine gun was unloaded on an Abnormality-18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: No bullet pierced the entity's carapace. Not a dent was recorded.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An Abnormality-18 was subjected to explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: If the explosions are strong enough, the entity's carapace may crack, allowing bullets to pierce the carapace and kill the entity.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An Abnormality-18 was put out of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The Abnormality-18 could survive out of water for indefinite amount of time, albeit being slower and less mobile.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An Abnormality-18 was subjected to scorching heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The Abnormality-18 died at 70 degree Celcius.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An Abnormality-18 was subjected to freezing temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-18 could survive ice cold temperature, but will freeze if the temperature is too cold. While frozen, Abnormality-18 is dormant. When the temperature increases, Abnormality-18 will come back to life.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The Abnormality-18 had the instinct to put out the fire, but couldn't. The Abnormality-18 survived, though injured.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An Abnormality-18 was killed. The raw meat was fed to an experimental subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The experimental subject died from food poisoning. Subsequent sub-tests shows similar results.
      </p>

        Test 18-7E
      </h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-8
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Acid was poured onto an Abnormality-18's carapace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The acid corroded the carapace, but the Abnormality-18's carapace healed after a week.

      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 18-9A
      </h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Medical checkup shows no poison in the subject's body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional notes: The poison fed to the Abnormality-18 was present in the blood and raw meat of the Abnormality-18.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 18-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-18s' carapace is very strong. Regular bullets, even if numbered in thousands, can never make a dent or a scratch on the entities' carapace. Explosions can crack the carapace, but bullets are required to kill Abnormality-18s after the carapace has been cracked. Abnormality-18s have the ability to survive without water for an indefinite period of time, though their mobility is severely decreased. Abnormality-18s will die in hot conditions, but will become frozen and dormant in cold temperature. If unfrozen, Abnormality-18s will come back to life.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 18-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-18s have basic survival instinct. When put on fire, the Abnormality-18 will attempt to put out the fire, although the entity will be unable to if no water is present nearby. Abnormality-18s' raw meat is dangerous to eat, but the cooked meat is always safe to eat. Abnormality-18s are immune to poison. No matter how much poison is consumed, Abnormality-18s will always be fine. Abnormality-18s' carapace can be corroded with acid, but the carapace will heal within a week. If any creature enters their territory, Abnormality-18s will become aggressive and immediately attack said creature. Additionally, Abnormality-18s are capable of climbing vertical walls using its legs and claws. No incidents have happened yet, but countermeasures to avoid them are already in place.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 18-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been permitted for Abnormality-18's carapace to be used by the organization's forces and occasionally, as construction materials. Abnormality-18's carapace are strong enough to resist cold or hot temperatures, bullets, explosions, and the likes. Abnormality-18's carapace are occasionally given to sponsoring nations. Abnormality-18's carapace may be used for construction, vehicles, and armor, but no ordnance or weapon may be created with the carapace. Additionally, Abnormality-18's carapace has been agreed collectively by sponsoring nations not to be sold or exported to prevent misuse or falling into the hands of hostile institutions or terrorists.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-18 was first found by the marine department near a beach in Cuba. Fishermen has reported seeing abnormally gigantic sea animals. The marine department sent ships to investigate. Nests of Abnormality-18s were found. All of them were secured and put in containment. The information department has covered up the incident.
