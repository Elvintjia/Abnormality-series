      <p>
        Abnormality-16 was found in a cave archeologists was digging. Abnormality-16 was friendly, but confused. Abnormality-16 did not know where the entity was. The unit was initially called to take the care of the entity, however, Abnormality-16 posed no threat unless provoked. The unit transported Abnormality-16 to the local government, but the local government refused to take custody of Abnormality-16. As a result, Abnormality-16 was instead given by the unit to the organization.
