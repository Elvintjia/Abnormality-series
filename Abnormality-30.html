        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-30 is a room containing an invisible ghost. Whilst in Abnormality-30, the ghost cannot be detected by sight, but can be heard and communicated with. The ghost is friendly in the first two minutes after a person enters Abnormality-30, but will then become sinister. The ghost will bombard the person with disturbing thoughts and strange ideas. If the person continues hearing it, the person will become willing to do whatever the ghost tells him to do. People under the ghost's control is designated as Abnormality-30As. The ghost typically orders Abnormality-30A to vandalize, murder, or commit other disturbing actions. An Abnormality-30A will revert to a normal human, that is no longer under the ghost's control, if the Abnormality-30A is denied the ghost's voice for long periods of time. The entrance to Abnormality-30 must always be guarded by at least two sentinels to prevent unauthorized entry.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 30-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        A sentinel guarding Abnormality-30's entrance became aggressive and attacked several staff members. The sentinel was restrained and later came back to his sense. The sentinel said he remembers everything he had done but does not remember why he did so. The sentinel claimed to have heard the ghost, but ignored it. He then started feeling strange and eventually attempted to go on a rampage. Investigation if the ghost can communicate with humans outside of Abnormality-30 is underway. Peculiarly, The sentinel never used his gun when he attacked, despite carrying it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 30-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        A staff member in the facility reported hearing some voices talking to him. A psychiatrist was called in to check him, but nothing out of the ordinary was found. After gaining approval, the staff member was ordered to enter Abnormality-30. The staff member was ordered to exit within 30 seconds of entering. After his exit, the staff member claimed the voice he heard was exactly the same as the ghost.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 30-3
      </h3>

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 30-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been concluded that the ghost in Abnormality-30 can communicate and influence people outside of Abnormality-30. The ghost has yet to communicate with anyone outside the facility. It is unclear how far the ghost's communication range is from Abnormality-30. However, the ghost's frequency of communication with anyone outside of Abnormality-30 is very low and does not pose as a security problem. Nevertheless, any staff member on site having heard a voice out of the blue should immediately report it and get psychiatric assistance. Abnormality-30's danger level has been increased to 2. Additionally, any person manipulated by the ghost seems to be incapable of using modern technology.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 30-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that everyone will hear a different version of the ghost's voice. No two person will hear the exact same version of the ghost's voice. Deaf people can hear the ghost's voice. Earplugs have no effect on the ghost's voice. Electronics and devices cannot record the ghost's voice. The ghost seems to be illiterate and unable to read any writing. Using ASL to communicate with the ghost will anger the ghost and may cause death to the communicating person. A person with some mental illness such as PTSD can be influenced much more easily by the ghost. Staying inside Abnormality-30 will cause hostility, but staying even longer may cause suicidal tendencies.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-30 was found in Ukraine. A group of teenagers entered an abandoned house as a test of guts. However, one of the teenagers entered Abnormality-30. Upon hearing the ghost, the teenager informed his friends and they all entered Abnormality-30. The incident resulted in 3 teenagers injured and 1 death amongst the teenagers. The police made investigations and local press was involved. After some covering up by the information department, Abnormality-30 was transported into the facility.
