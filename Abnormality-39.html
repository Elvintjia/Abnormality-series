        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-39 is a small penguin doll measuring 30 cm in height, 15 cm in length and width, and 1 kilogram in weight. Abnormality-39 is sentient and alive. Abnormality-39 is capable of interacting with human beings. However, Abnormality-39 only moves in the absence of humans above the age of 11. Abnormality-39 will move towards children under the age of 11 and seek one when there is none in the vicinity. Abnormality-39 can move at a maximum speed of 0.5 m/s and is acrobatic enough to climb furniture. Abnormality-39 can traverse vents as well as hide itself as necessary when humans above the age of 11 is in the general vicinity of the entity. Abnormality-39 can be observed when moving by camera or other recording devices. Abnormality-39 can also be observed while moving as long as the entity is unaware of being observed, for example, with a one way mirror. Abnormality-39 has no method of causing harm directly, and avoids doing anything that may cause harm to humans. When Abnormality-39 interacts with a human child, the human child will always be surprised and fascinated by the entity. The child will always like Abnormality-39, and will never tell anyone else regarding the entity’s living nature. If Abnormality-39 is taken away from a child, the child will miss Abnormality-39 for a period of several days, before forgetting and no longer remembering about Abnormality-39. As far as observation goes, no harmful effects have ever been recorded of Abnormality-39’s interactions with a human child. As such, testing the entity with children is permitted. Abnormality-39 must be kept under watch at all times, as the entity will actively seek a way out of the facility and get to a child below the age of 11. The containment room must be secured to prevent Abnormality-39’s escape. Abnormality-39 seem to require no sustenance, and has no way of communicating with humans other than using hand signals.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 39-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        An easier method of containment has been found. It is found that it is easier to simply have a staff member or a sentinel carry Abnormality-39 around to prevent Abnormality-39’s escape as Abnormality-39 is only capable of movement when no adults are present. Abnormality-39’s old containment room is to be used only for Abnormality-39’s testings. The personnel carrying Abnormality-39 is to be changed daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional notes: We should have thought about this containment method earlier.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 39-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-39 seems to have the ability to escape any imprisonment. Any attempts to lock Abnormality-39 in a kind of container will always result in Abnormality-39 escaping. Abnormality-39 has the intelligence to try and look for an escape route whenever the entity is trapped. Whatever tools Abnormality-39 needs for its escape will be produced by unknown means. Additionally, it has been determined Abnormality-39 is not as smart as previously thought. Abnormality-39 is unable to differentiate between a picture of a child and a real child. Recorded noises of a child can also fool Abnormality-39. Water and strong force seems to have no effect on the entity.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 39-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-39 has been determined to be inherently fearful of moving objects or living things that are non-human. Animals and moving objects such as jack in the box or robots will terrify Abnormality-39. Abnormality-39 will typically run and hide, never resorting to violence. Additionally, Abnormality-39 has been shown to be able to discern dolls apart. Abnormality-39 will always ignore dolls and rarely interact with them. However, baby dolls can fool Abnormality-39 for approximately 30 minutes before Abnormality-39 will begin ignoring it, unlike recording and pictures that can fool Abnormality-39 for an indefinite amount of time. Abnormality-39 has also been shown to be capable of cleaning itself and incapable of drowning.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-39 was found within a store. During closing hours, Abnormality-39 had wandered around a store and left the store to search for a child. CCTV footage confirmed the entity’s presence. Abnormality-39 was soon tracked and confiscated. Abnormality-39 had been put along with other penguin dolls of similar designs. The dolls had only been shipped to the store the day before and put on the store rack. The truck driver bringing in the toys were not aware of any oddities within the shipment. The staff at the toy factory was likewise unaware too. However, it has been determined that including Abnormality-39 in the total number of dolls shipped would make the number equal to the planned shipment. It is unknown if one of the dolls were switched with Abnormality-39, or the doll came to life and became Abnormality-39.
