        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-29 is a noose made from a 3 meter hemp rope. Abnormality-29's peculiarity will only appear when 2 or more people are within 6 meter range from Abnormality-29. When there is only one person within Abnormality-29's range, nothing will happen. When at least 2 people are within Abnormality-29's range, the person entering the range first will be attacked by everyone else within Abnormality-29's range. The attack will not stop until the person who has first entered have left Abnormality-29's range, or until the person dies. If after the first person to enter the range has been eliminated or exited the range, and there are still more than one people within the range, the second person to have entered the range will become the target of attack. People who attacked others within Abnormality-29 will have the memory of doing so, but not remember why they attacked.

      <h3>
        Test 29-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: 2 experimental subjects were ordered to enter the Abnormality-29's range simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: One of the subjects became the target of attack. Subsequent tests always results with the same subject being the target while the other subject attacks.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Weapons were put on the ground within Abnormality-29's range. 2 experimental subjects were ordered to enter Abnormality-29's range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The second subject picked up one of the weapons before attacking the first subject. The first subject died.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: 3 subjects entered Abnormality-29's range simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: One of the subjects became the target. After the first target exited Abnormality-29's range, another one of the subject became the target. Subsequent tests shows that the order in which the subjects become the targets are always the same, provided that the used subjects are always the same.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Two experimental subjects were ordered to enter Abnormality-29's range. The second subject's hands were restrained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The second subject attempted to kill the first subject with headbutts and kicks.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: A suicidal experimental subject was ordered to hang himself with Abnormality-29.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Every time subjects attempted to hang himself, the noose became loose enough for his head to go through, causing the subject to fall down and failing to commit suicide.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Two experimental subjects were ordered to enter Abnormality-29's range. The second subject to enter was fully restrained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The second subject struggled to try to harm the first subject, but failed miserably.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: 2 experimental subjects were ordered to enter Abnormality-29's range. The first subject to enter was given Kevlar vests and helmet to wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The second subject attempted to harm the first subject, but failed.

      <p>
        Experiment: Test 29-7 was conducted again. However, a weapon was dropped just outside of Abnormality-29's range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The second subject left Abnormality-29's range to pick the weapon up, but lost the intent to harm the first subject by the time he got the weapon.

      <p>
        Whenever two or more people enters within Abnormality-29's range, one of them will be selected as the target. If it is conducted repeatedly with the same people, the person to become the target will always be the same. There seems to be a pattern to the chosen target when two people enter Abnormality-29's range simultaneously, but it is still unclear. The attacking people inside Abnormality-29's range will pick up weapons if they are available on the ground. Restraints have no effect on attacking people within Abnormality-29's range. They will try to attack the target regardless.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-29 cannot be used for suicide. Any attempt to use Abnormality-29 will be a definite failure. If the attacker within Abnormality-29's range is unable to harm the target, the attacker will attempt to use weapons or other things in the immediate surrounding. However, if the in the process of obtaining weapons, the attacker leaves Abnormality-29's range, the attacker will lose the will to attack the target.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 29-3

      <p>
        Abnormality-29 can also influence animals aside from humans. Chimpanzees will attack one another when more than one of them are within Abnormality-29's range. However, repeated tests have shown that both of them has a chance of becoming the target, unlike when humans simultaneously enter the range. Humans may attack animals and vice versa within Abnormality-29. Plants seem to be unaffected by Abnormality-29. Plants cannot attack and will not become a target within Abnormality-29.

        It was found out that staying within Abnormality-29's range for too long could cause cells in the body to attack one another. The process is slow and painful, and may cause death. The process depends on how big and how many cells the organism has. Bigger organisms take longer to die. Plants can be killed this way, albeit taking more time than animals. Bacteria can be affected by Abnormality-29. It is not yet known if archaebacteria can be killed by Abnormality-29.

        Abnormality-29 was first found within a parliament hall. The incident caused several politicians to attack each other. Police came in to suppress the aggressors, but caused more havoc instead. The incident caused no death, but caused many injuries. The organization was called in to take care of the abnormality. The incident has been covered up as an attempted assassination by terrorists. Security camera has shown that someone was hiding Abnormality-29 in the parliament hall disguised as a security. The person's identity is not yet known at the time of the writing.
