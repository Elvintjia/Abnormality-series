	  Description
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-41 is a clown weighing approximately 64 kg and having a height of 169 cm. Abnormality-41 looks like a clown in general, wearing clown costumes and having clown make up at all times. Abnormality-41 is friendly towards strangers and likes to tell jokes. However, the jokes are always dark humour and offensive to some people. If the person listening to the jokes told Abnormality-41 the joke isn’t funny, Abnormality-41 would immediately kill the person. The method of killing varies each time. If the person reacts with laughter, Abnormality-41 would smile and thank the person for laughing, and will promptly leave. If the person reacts with telling Abnormality-41 that the joke is offensive, Abnormality-41 will apologize and reply with an equally offensive joke. If Abnormality-41 gets ignored, Abnormality-41 will calmly leave, but if the entity was ignored twice in a row, Abnormality-41 will kill the next person ignoring the entity. Fatalities caused by Abnormality-41 can be easily prevented, but standard containment measures aren’t enough as Abnormality-41 can walk through doors and enter vents no matter how small they are, but not walls. Abnormality-41 can see through poorly attempted fake laughter and will respond hostilely, so caution when laughing is advised. Abnormality-41 does not need sustenance, but will eat food given to the entity.

	  Incidents
	</h2>
	<h3>
	  Incident 41-1
	</h3>
	<p>
	  In the aftermath of a breakout incident, a paramedic staff was working to look for survivors and injured people in the facility. However, the paramedic staff encountered Abnormality-41, which proceeded to try and make an offensive joke. The paramedic staff, unaware that Abnormality-41 can be hostile, proceeded to tell Abnormality-41 to leave him alone and come back later on, as he was busy with looking for and treating injured people. Peculiarly, Abnormality-41 complied and left the paramedic staff alone. Abnormality-41 would then reappear a few hours after the first encounter. The paramedic staff has reported the first encounter and therefore, could prepare a fake laugh to satisfy Abnormality-41. Abnormality-41 smiled and left the paramedic staff alone.
	</p>
	<h2 class="Border" id="Adde">
	  Addenda
	</h2>
	<h3>
	  Addendum 41-1
	</h3>
	<p>
	  It has been determined that despite the antisocial behavior of Abnormality-41, Abnormality-41 can still behave according to ordinary common sense. Abnormality-41 won’t approach people who are afraid of clowns and will explain his jokes when prompted. Incident 41-1 reveals that Abnormality-41 can be reasoned with and talked to, not bothering someone when asked politely. A new protocol has been put in place to avoid possible casualties by Abnormality-41. Abnormality-41 will explain jokes when prompted and leave after the person asking the joke understands or pretends to understand. Abnormality-41 has been determined to be unable to tell if someone is pretending not to understand the joke, therefore allowing an easier method of deceiving Abnormality-41 to avoid casualty. Recent tests have also shown Abnormality-41 to be invincible to conventional weaponry. However, more tests needs to be conducted to confirm the entity’s invincibility.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  Addendum 41-2
	</h3>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-41 has been proven to be nearly invincible. All attempts to injure and destroy Abnormality-41 have failed. Peculiarly, Abnormality-41 will only react hostilely to a melee attack. Guns, explosives, and other attacks will not cause Abnormality-41 to turn aggressive. However, stabbing or hitting Abnormality-41 will immediately cause Abnormality-41 to react and terminate the attacker. However, it was found out that tranquilizers can be effective against Abnormality-41, as Abnormality-41 will fall asleep for 2 minutes should the entity be shot by a tranquilizer. It is not yet known if Abnormality-41 can obtain immunity to the tranquilizer. Additionally, any attempts at being mean to Abnormality-41 is bound to immediately provoke Abnormality-41. Abnormality-41 will kill any people attempting to be mean to it and will surprisingly save people from bullying, though the method of saving is killing the bully. Abnormality-41 seems to wish to be the funniest clown on Earth and to that extent, will murder other clowns. Staff members have been warned to never try to associate themselves with comedy and clowns in the facility.

	  Origin
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Abnormality-41 was found in a park in a city with plenty of corpses. Camera feed shows that Abnormality-41 entered the park after coming out of the city sewers. Abnormality-41 proceeded to talk to joggers and local civilians. Abnormality-41 made offensive jokes and murdered people who did not laugh at his jokes. Police was called in and the police arrested Abnormality-41. However, upon realization that Abnormality-41 is an abnormality, the organization was called to take in Abnormality-41, as the local government is completely unwilling to take responsibility of containing the entity.
