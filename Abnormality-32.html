        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-32 is a paperclip measuring roughly 5 cm and made of iron. Abnormality-32 can be used to open any kind of doors or locks, without the need to be skilled or experienced at picking locks. No known lock or security system can prevent the use of Abnormality-32. Even vaults without keyholes or state of the art security systems cannot resist Abnormality-32. Abnormality-32 can only be used by each person once to open a lock or door. Any attempts to use Abnormality-32 by the same person will always result in a failure. Abnormality-32 is resistant to acid and rust.

      <h3>
        Addendum 32-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Test results have shown that Abnormality-32 can open anything, including vehicle doors, safes, and any lock in this world, regardless of how sophisticated or complex. Even doors without keyholes or biometric locks can be opened with Abnormality-32. Exceptions are digital locks such as account password, phone pin password, and the likes. Abnormality-32 can only be used as a lock. Any attempt to use it otherwise, for instance, as a key car, will not work.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 32-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been revealed that Abnormality-32 can also be used to lock doors. It has been determined that every person can each lock doors and open doors with Abnormality-32 just once. There appears to be no limit to which door can be locked with Abnormality-32. Exceptions are doors with no locks. Biometric doors can be locked with Abnormality-32, but it will result in the door being impossible to be reopened except with Abnormality-32, and by the same person. Investigation is underway to determine how far Abnormality-32’s locking and unlocking capability goes.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-32 was found between the belongings of a thief. The thief had managed to break in a bank and steal a large sum of money. Security was tight and no malfunctioning or hacking was detected within the bank’s security system. However, the thief had left fingerprints and DNA during his infiltration. The thief’s face was also recorded on camera. A large scale operation was conducted to find the thief and the stolen money. The thief was caught and arrested a week after the heist. When interrogated, the thief claimed to have a miracle paperclip that can be used to open any lock. Police dismissed the thief’s claim. Watchmen caught wind of the incident. After investigation, it was found that the thief’s claim is correct. Abnormality-32 was later handed to the organization.
