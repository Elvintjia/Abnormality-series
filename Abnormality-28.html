        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-28 is a plastic mask resembling the famous CEO Steve Job. The mask is approximately 16 cm tall and 14 cm wide, though it is able to change its measurements based on the wearer. If Abnormality-28 is worn by someone, that person will have the face of Steve Jobs upon taking Abnormality-28 off. The person with Steve Job's face is hereby designated as Abnormality-28A. No known method could undo the effects, besides plastic surgery. The process is instantaneous.

      <h3>
        Incident 28-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        During a breakout incident, a debris fell on Abnormality-28. Abnormality-28 was retrieved, though damaged and with no know way of repairing it. A few days after the incident, staff member William noticed that Abnormality-28 was changing itself despite being left alone. A few days after, Abnormality-28 is now a mask that resembles Nikola Tesla.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 28-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        A series of test has been conducted to determine Abnormality-28's properties. Abnormality-28 will change a wearing person's face to Steve Job's regardless of gender. Simply pressing Abnormality-28 against a person's face is enough to change the person's face. Animals belonging to the primate order can have their face changed by Abnormality-28. Abnormality-28 has no effect on dead people. Pressing Abnormality-28 on any body parts other than the face will cause no effect.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 28-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that wearing Abnormality-28 for a long period of time will cause the wearer to resemble Steve Jobs even more. Wearing Abnormality-28 for an hour will cause the wearer to be fluent in English and speak like Steve Jobs. Wearing Abnormality-28 for 2 hours will cause the wearer's eyesight to worsen. The wearer will need the same eyeglass prescription Steve Job wore to see clearly. Wearing Abnormality-28 for 4 hours will cause the wearer's hairstyle to change to match Steve Job's. If the wearer has a beard, mustache, or the likes, they too will change accordingly. Wearing Abnormality-28 for 8 hours will change the wearer's vocal chord to match Steve Job's voice. Wearing Abnormality-28 for 16 hours will cause the wearer's voice to become a perfect imitation of Steve Job's voice.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 28-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been revealed that crushing or damaging Abnormality-28 will cause it to repair itself within 6 days. However, every time Abnormality-28 repairs itself, Abnormality-28 will mimic a different person's face. There is not yet a clear pattern as to which person's face Abnormality-28 will mimic. Abnormality-28's effects will change accordingly to the face it currently mimics. The effects of wearing Abnormality-28 for a long time will be approximately the same regardless of the face Abnormality-28 mimics.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-28 was obtained from an aftermath of a battle between the union and the cult. The union conducted a raid against a cult outpost. The resulting firefight caused the cult to abandon the outpost whilst saving as many abnormalities as possible. The union destroyed the remaining abnormalities and left the outpost. Local government noticed the battle and called in the organization to investigate the outpost. During the sweeping of the outpost, Abnormality-28 was found, presumably ignored by the union because it resembles an ordinary Steve Job mask.
