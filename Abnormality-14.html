        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-14 is a 50 cm × 45 cm × 30 cm white microwave. Abnormality-14 has a electric cable, despite not requiring electricity to run. Abnormality-14 only has 2 buttons on its side. One to open Abnormality-14 and put food inside, and the other for the microwave to start cooking. If any food is put inside Abnormality-14, and the cook button is pressed, Abnormality-14 will cook the food put inside it. The duration time for cooking is different depending on the food put inside. The duration typically lasts 3 to 5 minutes. After the cooking is done, Abnormality-14 will continuously beep until the open button is pressed. The cooked food will become extremely delicious to eat, regardless of whoever is eating the food. No incidents or problems have ever occurred at the writing of this report, therefore Abnormality-14 is free to use by staff member, but caution is still advised.

      <p>
        In test 14-15, human meat was put inside Abnormality-14 was cooked. The resulting food was a new type of abnormality. This abnormality is designated as Abnormality-14A. Abnormality-14A is mobile and causes headache and stomachache within ten meter radius. Abnormality-14A was swift and sentient. Containment was difficult. If the headache and stomachache continues, the victims may die. Sentinels failed to contain Abnormality-14, and the abnormality was destroyed with a flamethrower.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-14 was first found within an abandoned house in Italy. A journal entry was found next to the abnormality. The journal seems to record the creator of Abnormality-14's process of making the entity. The motive for the entities creation is to use the entity to help with world hunger. However, the process deviated from the original plan. Nevertheless, the creator continued the project until it is complete. However, the creator realized the entity cannot be mass produced, and it is also unlikely to be able to solve world hunger. A corpse was found next to the journal, presumed to be the creator's. Autopsy showed that the presumed creator's corpse had a cardiac arrest and died.
