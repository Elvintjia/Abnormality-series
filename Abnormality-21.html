        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-21 is a 15 cm long brush. If Abnormality-21 is used to paint on a flat surface, whatever is painted can become reality. Anything is possible. Abnormality-21 does not need paint to paint. Abnormality-21's colors automatically changes according to the painter's will when painted on the canvas. No matter how badly a painting is drawn using Abnormality-21, as long as the painter has an idea of what is being painted, the painting will become reality.

        Incidents

      <h3>
        Incident 21-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-21 was seen on camera to be drawing something on the wall of its containment room, despite no one being inside with it. Staff members accompanied by sentinels entered the containment room. Abnormality-21 was floating without anyone using it. After that, a crocodile, which Abnormality-21 was drawing, appeared. Sentinels immediately killed the crocodile. Abnormality-21 fell onto the floor. Investigation has been made yet it is still unknown what caused Abnormality-21's behavior.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 21-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-21 painted on the wall of its containment room without a user again. This time however, an abnormality was born. The abnormality caused a breakout incident in which twenty personnel were killed and many were injured. Only then was it realized that Abnormality-21's limit of capability is virtually non-existent. Abnormality-21 could possibly make anything. Debates to destroy Abnormality-21 is ongoing.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 21-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Anything that is drawn with Abnormality-21, will really be drawn to life. This includes living things and complex machinery. Extinct creatures can also be brought back. Complex machinery will appear in the best quality available and with factory customization. This includes weapons and vehicles. Additionally, Abnormality-21 is capable of producing food. Said food is also safe to eat. Lastly, Abnormality-21 seems to be capable of painting by itself. Whether Abnormality-21 is sentient or what triggered it to paint by itself is still under investigation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 21-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        After the revelation of incident 21-2, it was realized that Abnormality-21 does not have a limitation as to what it can produce. It can even produce abnormalities, dangerous ones as well. Abnormality-21 was deemed too dangerous, and a debate ensued of whether to destroy it. However, during the debate, professor Diana found out a way to contain Abnormality-21. If Abnormality-21 was used to paint on uneven surface, the painting won't become the real thing. As such, destruction of Abnormality-21 was cancelled and the containment room was changed. So far, it has successfully prevented Abnormality-21 from painting by itself. It has been decided that a canvas can only be brought into the containment room for testing. Otherwise, no flat surface objects may be brought into the containment room. Testing is still permitted, however utmost caution is required when testing. Abnormality-21's danger level stays as five because of how dangerous it is.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-21 was found within the belongings of a Russian artist. The Russian artist had painted countless works before dying. After the artist's death, his apprentice used his brush as a memory of her master. The brush caused what she drew to turn into life. She reported the incident to police. Subsequently, the organization was sent to take in the abnormality. In the artist's diary, it was found out that the artist obtained Abnormality-21 as a Christmas gift from an unknown sender. The artist was aware of Abnormality-21's powers, but decided to keep it a secret from everyone.
