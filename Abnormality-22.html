        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-22 is a seemingly ordinary eyeglass. However, when worn, Abnormality-22 will show a distorted reality of what the wearing person desires. The eyeglass does not change reality. It only changes the reality seen through the glass. Any reality can be seen through Abnormality-22 if the person has strong enough desire for it. If worn for too long, Abnormality-22 will cause discomfort for the user, eventually causing the user to take off Abnormality-22.

        Incident 22-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        After test 22-8, the ex-stalker started to stalk his old victim. Watchmen realized it and informed police about it. The stalker was apprehended quickly. In light of the incident, Abnormality-22 is forbidden to be used on potentially dangerous individuals, to prevent more incidents similar in nature from happening.

      <h3>
        Addendum 22-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-22 will show different things to the wearer depending on the wearer's desires. However, if the desires aren't strong enough, nothing will be shown. Additionally, Abnormality-22 could cause discomfort for people wearing the glasses for too long or for people who do not need glasses but wear Abnormality-22. The discomfort will continue for as long as Abnormality-22 is worn, but nothing goes beyond the small sense of discomfort. Blind people can in no way make use of Abnormality-22. Additionally, it is noticed that dust never sticks on Abnormality-22. Further experiments are planned on Abnormality-22.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-22 was obtained from a man who was boasting online. The man had found Abnormality-22 in his backyard a few days prior. The man tried wearing it and also lent it to other people. After knowing Abnormality-22's peculiarity, the man boasted online about having a magical eyeglass. Due to accounts of friend and family supporting the man's claims, watchmen investigated the man. It was found out that the man was telling the truth. Abnormality-22 was confiscated, and the man was interrogated. The man claimed to know nothing about where the eyeglass was from.
