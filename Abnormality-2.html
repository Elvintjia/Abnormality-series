        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-2 consists of two things. A piece of paper and a hooded figure, respectively designated as Abnormality-2A and Abnormality-2B. Abnormality-2A is a piece of paper made from goat skin. On Abnormality-2A, a text is written. However, the text on Abnormality-2A is always perceived differently by each person. One person could see a Gandhi quote in the text, another could be reading a philosophical message written by Plato. No two person could see the same version of texts, even through photo or video. Abnormality-2B is a hooded figure that arrives in random time everyday to write on Abnormality-2A. Abnormality-2B wears a purple cloak that covers its entire body. Abnormality-2B has a black skin colour, with seemingly no hair and no facial features, almost like a mannequin. Abnormality-2B will always arrive through a black portal appearing near Abnormality-2A. During Abnormality-2B's presence, Abnormality-2A will always be seemingly blank. Abnormality-2B will proceed to conjure a quill out of thin air, and write something down on Abnormality-2A. Abnormality-2A will continue to be blank, even as Abnormality-2B writes upon it. after up to 5 minutes of writing, Abnormality-2B will then leave through the same black portal. The black portal will disappear, and texts of writings will appear on Abnormality-2A. Note that Abnormality-2 may seem harmless, but it is not. See incident 2-1 for explanation. Whenever Abnormality-2A is to be viewed, at least two personnel must view it at the same time and any out of character behavior must be reported. Personnel acting strangely must be sent to a psychiatrist for psychiatric assistance.

      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-2B understands all spoken language and what Abnormality-2B says can always be understood by everyone, regardless of language difference. Video and audio recording yields similar results.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Two experimental subjects with two different mother tongue were asked to read Abnormality-2A
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Both subjects claimed the text was written in their own respective mother tongue.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject was asked to attempt entering the black portal Abnormality-2B uses to enter and exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Experimental subject could not enter the portal due to an invisible barrier blocking him, although Abnormality-2B can enter the portal with ease.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-5
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: An experimental subject was asked to write something down on Abnormality-2A
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Nothing changed on Abnormality-2A despite the experimental subject repeatedly trying to write something.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-2A was put on a very high platform out of reach. Abnormality-2B's actions were observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-2B floated to the platform to write on Abnormality-2A. Method of floating is still unknown. Abnormality-2B proceeded to land on the ground and reenter the black portal he came from.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Abnormality-2A was put inside a thick safe. How Abnormality-2B would write on Abnormality-2A was observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Camera feed inside the safe shows that a black portal opened inside the safe and Abnormality-2B's hand emerged from the portal. Abnormality-2B's hand conjured a quill and wrote on the Abnormality-2A before pulling his hand back. Portal then disappeared and the text on Abnormality-2A changed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-8
      </h3>
      <p>
        Experiment: Several personnel attempted to stop Abnormality-2B from writing on Abnormality-2A at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Gone horribly wrong. See incident 2-2.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Test 2-9

        Incident 2-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member Ferdinand read what was written on Abnormality-2A. Afterwards, staff member Ferdinand let out a creepy and strange laugh. Staff member Ferdinand then acted strangely out of character and then proceeded to commit suicide not long after. It was unknown what staff member Ferdinand had read, but it is speculated to have something in connection a trauma he has. Safety protocols have been enacted to prevent similar occurrences.

      <h3>
        Incident 2-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        In test 2-8, staff members attempt to stop Abnormality-2B from writing on Abnormality-2B. Sentinels were watching the experiment in case something unexpected happens. Abnormality-2B appeared and approached Abnormality-2A. Staff members tried distracting or even convincing Abnormality-2B not to write on Abnormality-2A. Abnormality-2B ignored them and tried to get to Abnormality-2A. Staff members blocked Abnormality-2B's way. Abnormality-2B then politely asked staff members to step out of the way and let him through. The staff member refused. Abnormality-2B then became aggressive and pulled out a knife, stabbing staff members blocking the way. Sentinels immediately interfered. In the ensuing firefight, Abnormality-2B was shot several times and was terminated. Abnormality-2B's body dropped after being shot twice and spilled no blood. Abnormality-2B's body disappeared over a period of 2 minutes, and so did the black portal. After the portal and Abnormality-2B's body disappear, every personnel involved saw that the text on Abnormality-2A written as "You will regret that." Personnel uninvolved in the incident saw the Abnormality-2A as blank, with nothing written. At midnight, all personnel involved in the test had a heart attack simultaneously. No one survived.

      <h3>
        Incident 2-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        Staff member named Boris attempted to invite Abnormality-2B to tea after the entity has written in Abnormality-2A. Abnormality-2B accepted the invitation and went to drink tea with staff member Boris. Abnormality-2B was capable of smelling and drinking tea, though facial features like a mouth are not present. Abnormality-2B remarked that the tea of our world tastes much better than tea in the entities world. Staff member Boris talked with Abnormality-2B about various things. Unfortunately, nothing of the conversation has been recorded. Eventually, Abnormality-2B finished his tea and left. Before leaving, Abnormality-2B thanked staff member Boris and said he would happily come to drink tea again.

      <h3>
        Incident 2-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        A group of staff members have conducted a forbidden test on Abnormality-2. An experimental subject was ordered to shoot Abnormality-2B. Afterwards, everyone involved in the scheme escaped using an aeroplane to a different time zone. The goal of the test was to see what would happen if anyone involved in the incident were to flee to another time zone and hence never got to midnight. Every single staff member involved died due to heart attack simultaneously when the local time of Abnormality-2A's location reach midnight. After the incident, security level of Abnormality-2 is increased to avoid forbidden experiments from being conducted again in the future.

      <p>
        After incident 2-3, Abnormality-2B regularly drinks tea with staff members after writing on Abnormality-2A. Staff members must invite Abnormality-2B to tea when he appears and are encouraged to chat with Abnormality-2B to get information, though it is warned that staff members should not ask sensitive questions or enforce opinions. Abnormality-2A's containment chamber is to be furnished with a table and some chairs. Tea must be prepared at all times for in case that Abnormality-2B arrive. At least one staff member must always watch over Abnormality-2A. All conversations with Abnormality-2B is to be recorded. Abnormality-2B will normally chat and drink tea for up to twenty minutes before thanking staff members and leaving.

      <p>
        Abnormality-2 was found in one of the cult's outpost. Watchmen reported its location and commandos were sent to raid it. A firefight ensued. Due to the commandos superior training and technologically advanced equipment, the cult members were wiped out. Those that couldn't participate in combat either chose suicide or fleeing. Abnormality-2 was found within one of the rooms of the outpost. Abnormality-2 was first thought to be an ancient manuscript, however it was quickly proven as an abnormality. Abnormality-2 was then brought back to the organization's facility.
