        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-33 is a female Siberian cat measuring 5.4 kg. Abnormality-33 has survived past the usual lifespans of cats and is at least 30 years old. Abnormality-33 seems not to age even after years within the organization. Abnormality-33 is somewhat incorporeal. Abnormality-33 can eat the fish fed to the entity, yet it is able to walk through walls unopposed. Cages are not effective in containing Abnormality-33. Additionally, no known methods of harming Abnormality-33 exist. Any attempt to harm Abnormality-33 has failed. Any physical objects will go through Abnormality-33, and temperature seems to have no effect on Abnormality-33. Abnormality-33 has a collar with the name tag “Fluffy” attached. Abnormality-33 seems to have some level of sentience. Abnormality-33 will react upon being called “Fluffy” and understands orders or instructions. Abnormality-33 is completely harmless, therefore the entity is given free roam of the facility.

        Incidents
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Incident 33-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        An employee was cooking fish with Abnormality-14 when Abnormality-33 was around. Abnormality-33 caught the smell of fish and entered Abnormality-33. Abnormality-14’s cooking process could not be cancelled, and attempts to stop the cooking process failed. A few minutes later, the cooking process had succeeded and Abnormality-14 could be opened. Abnormality-33 was inside Abnormality-14 and was unharmed. One of the cooked fish was missing, presumably eaten by Abnormality-33. Caution is to be taken when using Abnormality-14 when Abnormality-33 is present.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 33-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        During a breakout incident, Abnormality-33 was reportedly missing. After the escaping abnormality was subdued, Abnormality-33 was found by sentinels at the front entrance of the facility. Abnormality-33 led sentinels to the entity’s caretaker injured and trapped under rubble, as well as several other staff member which the entity has previously interacted with. Abnormality-33 also led the sentinels to bodies of deceased staff members. Abnormality-33 showed great intelligence by leading the sentinels through hallways and rooms as opposed to going through walls as it would be the fastest route to reach the injured staff members. Investigation regarding Abnormality-33’s intelligence is currently underway.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 33-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been found out that starving or poisoning Abnormality-33 is an ineffective method to kill the entity. No methods of killing Abnormality-33 has been found. Abnormality-33 is capable of swimming in water and predators will constantly fail to eat Abnormality-33 due to Abnormality-33’s seemingly incorporeal body. Fire and gas too, will fail to have an effect on Abnormality-33. Abnormality-33 does not trigger allergy in people and are very friendly with dogs. Abnormality-33 can feed on anything. Abnormality-33 cannot be killed by falling from great heights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional notes: Please refrain from using informal languages or languages that are less than appropriate. Fall damage has been changed to falling from great heights.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 33-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-33 is confirmed to be quite sentient. Abnormality-33 was seemingly capable of reading books and understanding hand signals. However, Abnormality-33 seems to be unable to understand spoken orders. Abnormality-33 is smart enough, as shown in incident 33-2. Abnormality-33 led sentinels to injured personnel. Abnormality-33 even refrained from going through walls to lead the sentinels properly. Further investigation regarding Abnormality-33’s sentience is underway. Additionally, Abnormality-33 seems to have no danger awareness. Abnormality-33 always eats whatever is fed to the entity, never tries to run from predators, and never shows any fear.

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-33 was found and brought in by a watchman. The watchman had taken Abnormality-33 from the streets because the watchman thought the entity was cute. Abnormality-33’s status as an abnormality was only realized after Abnormality-33 walked through a wall. Abnormality-33 was brought under the organization, and the watchman became the entity’s caretaker. It is unknown when Abnormality-33 was born and how.
