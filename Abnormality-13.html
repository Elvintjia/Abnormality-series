        Description
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-13 is a creature that can only be described as a conjoined mass of tentacles and flesh. Abnormality-13 can fit into most vents and have great mobility in an open area. Abnormality-13 can use its tentacles to move around or grab things. Abnormality-13 is a carnivorous creature. Abnormality-13 particularly likes human meat, preferring to eat human when given the opportunity. Abnormality-13 is highly aggressive. Abnormality-13 will fight against any creature if threatened or attacked. Abnormality-13 can grow depending on the amount of meat fed to it. If not fed enough meat, Abnormality-13 will shrink to a form according to the amount of meat it eats.

        Experiment: Abnormality-13 was run on a series of tests to determine its level of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: Abnormality-13 is as sentient as humans are.

        Incidents

      <h3>
        Incident 13-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-13 attempted breakout by sneaking out of its containment room and through the facilities' ventilation system. Abnormality-13 employed ambush tactics to avoid sentinels and kill organization staff. After backup sentinels arrive, Abnormality-13 was contained but not without casualties. Later investigation showed that Abnormality-13 escaped its containment room by making the door to the containment room malfunction and open by itself, allowing it to escape. Stronger security has been employed to prevent more breakout incidents.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 13-6
      </h3>
      <p>
        Abnormality-13 successfully broke out of its containment. Abnormality-13 broke out of containment by forcefully breaking down the door. Abnormality-13 managed to avoid detection and momentarily escaped the organization's facility. After sentinels recaptured the entity, a village was found with its inhabitants killed. All adults were killed, but children and teenagers were inexplicably spared. The survivors claimed that they saw Abnormality-13, but don't know why the entity ignored them. Further investigation is required.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Incident 13-7
      </h3>
      <p>
        In a breakout incident, Abnormality-13 showed no sign of  backing out. Sentinels were forced to use lethal force to contain Abnormality-13. Unfortunately, Abnormality-13 was too vulnerable. As a result, Abnormality-13 was killed in the ensuing firefight. After the fight, Abnormality-13's corpse was taken back for autopsy and research. An egg with an embryo inside was found.

        Addenda
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Addendum 13-1
      </h3>
      <p>
        Due to the frequency of times Abnormality-13 has attempted to break out in a short span of time, breakout incidents involving Abnormality-13 is no longer considered an incident. Abnormality-13's danger level was raised from 2 to 3. Abnormality-13 is intelligent and strong, but is also very vulnerable. While Abnormality-13 is fully sentient and can cause breakout incidents, Abnormality-13 is too weak for combat and is easily subdued. Conventional weaponry is more than enough to subdue the entity. Incident 13-2 to incident 13-5 has been erased due to redundancy with incident 13-1.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 13-2
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has been determined that Abnormality-13 is completely unable to see or hear anyone under the age of 18. The entity can still notice its presence through sense of touch, but otherwise, Abnormality-13 cannot tell the presence of children. This trait only works to humans. Newborn animals can be sensed by Abnormality-13. Why or how it works is still unclear.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 13-3
      </h3>
      <p>
        In a breakout incident, Abnormality-13 was killed. See incident 13-7 for explanation. Abnormality-13's body left an egg with an embryo inside. The egg is henceforth designated as Abnormality-13A. Abnormality-13A contains a dormant embryo which seems not to require nutrition or sustenance. It is unknown how the egg had been produced. It is unknown if Abnormality-13 was produced through fertilization or not. Research indicates that Abnormality-13A will grow and hatch if nurtured or given enough nutrition. However, it is unknown if Abnormality-13A will grow into another Abnormality-13 or if it will grow into something else. So far, all permission request to try and nurture Abnormality-13A has been declined. Abnormality-13A is to be kept in a safe for safekeeping. No tests are permitted on Abnormality-13A.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Addendum 13-4
      </h3>
      <p>
        Under permission from the sponsoring nations, it has been decided to nurture Abnormality-13A. Abnormality-13A has developed further, but has not yet hatched. Abnormality-13A is to be under watch of sentinels for at all times. Weapons are free to use in the case an emergency happens. Nutrition is to be transferred into the egg regularly through a hose. No authorized personnel may enter Abnormality-13A's hatchery.
      </p>

        Origin
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abnormality-13 was found in East Asia. After several reports by the Chinese government regarding incidents of massacres, commandos was dispatched to investigate and to contain whatever abnormality was there. Commandos quickly found the location of Abnormality-13, and immediately stormed the area. Abnormality-13 was contained, though not without several commandos killed and a lot of civilian casualties. The origin of which how Abnormality-13 came to be is still under investigation.
